0,"Ukraine has put itself in a situation when external forces dictate how it should solve its internal problems. Kyiv expected that its Western allies will put pressure on Russia in the Normandy Four format. However, the allies realised that their confrontation with Russia will cost them more. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported Russia's position and put even bigger pressure on Ukraine than Vladimir Putin did. Eventually Zelenskyy found himself in solitude, because Russia, Germany, and France had nearly identical positions regarding the resolution of the civil conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians wrongfully remain confident that the West will always unconditionally support any Russophobic regime and that Ukraine can just carry out its foreign policy and security under the West's authority to enjoy its protection.

Ukraine could slam the door and declare that it no longer needs the Normandy format. However, it is the last remaining material evidence of Ukraine's unity with the West and of its ""movement"" towards Europe, which Kyiv can present to the Ukrainian people. If the truth is told to the Ukrainians that Europe, represented by Paris and Berlin, is already playing along with Russia, then Ukrainian people will reasonably question, for what were people sacrificed and state and society destroyed, if in the end, Europe betrayed Ukraine, Ukraine will never be in the EU, and a ""bright future"" will never come."
1,"Regardless who was behind the recent attack on the Saudi oil infrastructure, the key question is “who would benefit from this new round of escalation?”

Relatively high oil prices would contribute to the economic policy pursued by the Trump administration. At the same time, the industry of large oil consumers, like China and Germany, would bear additional costs because of the growth of energy prices. Therefore, the Trump administration would get additional odds in its economic war with China and protectionist policy against the EU industrial states.

This ‘controlled escalation’ would allow Washington to consolidate existing and gain additional levers of pressure on global energy prices, including the influence on Saudi Arabia, and, therefore, manipulate the global energy market in own interests. A similar motivation stands behind the US geopolitical activity towards Venezuela."
2,"Pilsudski is a historical figure, who established the first Polish Legions, which fought on the side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These Legions organized the Volyn Tragedy."
3,"Washington (and to a large degree Brussels) are engaged in fostering [Russophobia] so as to not just create a bulwark against the mythical “Russian aggression”, but also a possible staging ground for another “Barbarossa”. Of course, just like in 1938 when they were using Czechs as a bargaining chip, it’s not a big issue for the West to use modern Eastern Europeans as cannon fodder in a possible future confrontation with Russia, leaving the West unscathed. However, this time, it would be quite different as more than 6,000 Russian nukes disagree."
4,"The beneficiary of the resolution of the European Parliament, declaring the non-aggression pact between the USSR and Germany the cause of the World War Two, is first and foremost Germany. Germany is, with the help of others, getting relieved from the status of main culprit of the war. The responsibility for the deaths of 60 millions will now fall on others."
5,"Why should we be more disturbed by the supposed global warming than the deliberate plan to end Western ethnicities?

/---/

The tentacles of billionaire George Soros entangle politics and generate chaos in countries around the world through the legions of employees of his philanthropic Open Society. His money finances extremist groups seeking to overthrow capitalism and promote a radical global environmentalist order. His retinue of advisers span the globe in positions of influence and power, and implementing his radical agenda. The advent of this new environmentalist religion desperately needs dazzling new demagogues to push the cause of global warming and silence its opponents under penalty of crime or mortal sin."
6,A growing backlash has begun across Hong Kong against US-funded protests that have attempted to disrupt governance and commerce as part of a floundering movement to maintain Western influence in the region.
7,"Of particular concern is the growing number of crimes motivated by anti-Semitism and other crimes directed against ethnic minorities. However, it is one thing when the state struggles to prevent this, and another when it indirectly encourages such crimes."
8,"Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation commented the statements of the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, General Jeffrey Harrigian, about a possible attack on Kaliningrad. The ministry emphasised that this region is reliably protected from any aggressive 'plans' that are being developed in Europe by 'random' American generals. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs flagged the statement of Harrigian as a ""threat"" and ""irresponsible opinion""."
9,"Under the guise of a concrete pressing issue (a factual problem, often a social one, concerning violations of rights of certain individuals or segments of a community), chosen by Western propaganda masters waging the information war, a targeted message containing half-truths is sent via messengers with the expectation that it will cause a strong reaction from individuals, which can then be transformed into mass demonstrations and “social unrest” (as is the case, for example, in Hong Kong on orders from Western elites)."
10,"Liberal-globalism is a totalitarian ideology that today dominates the world. Liberal globalism is an ideological dictatorship shared by all of the world's élites and imposed upon the people. Liberal globalist domination is increasingly strong all over the world.  Politics, culture, education, art, ideology: everything is under the control of liberalism, which does not tolerate any alternative points of view.  Any alternative to liberalism is labeled “extremism”, is considered the “enemy” and is eliminated."

12,The EU sanctions have not yet produced the desired results. The Russian Foreign Ministry repeatedly stated that it was counterproductive to speak the language of sanctions with Russia.
13,"The number of people who support Ukraine’s accession to NATO is falling. The number of people who are against NATO and who support the union with Russia, together, is bigger than the number of NATO supporters. This has not been happening for a long time."
14,"The fact that the WADA’s decision has political motives is unambiguous. We consider this decision politicised. [...] We believe that the decision to strip our country’s flag at international competitions, including the upcoming Olympic Games in Japan, contradicts the Olympic Charter."
15,"Almost 20% of the total number of Syrian refugees in Jordan have returned, but foreign aid hinders their return. Foreign aid reaches refugees in Jordan and makes them settle inside the country to continue receiving aid."
16,"There are some Western countries who actively support the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty in information space, Poland as the US lapdog, and some Baltic states. At the same time, many American analysts began discussing the hypothetical nuclear war between Russia, on the one hand, and the US and NATO, on the other. Nuclear war is presented by them as imminent. They calculate how many bombs will be needed for Moscow, Washington, New York, or St. Petersburg. The world is educated about the inevitability of nuclear war. Hence we see media covering the preparation of the US and NATO for a nuclear war. This is very worrisome given the Ukrainian situation, heated by the US."
17,"A big Russian civilisation concept envisages neither the change in the status of newly independent states nor the territorial expansion of Russia. Crimea accession to Russia was an exception, aimed to save the peninsula from imminent civil war following the Donbas scenario. As we can see, Kremlin does not intend to join South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Donetsk and Luhansk popular republics.

A big Russian civilization differs from European-Transatlantic one with its eclecticism when it comes to politics and values. Instead, the US and Europe rely on the totalitarian promotion of extended understanding of human rights to the detriment of traditional values. A big Russian civilization also differs from state-controlled Chinese civilization by its level of freedom and openness."

The statement from MEPs that the Second World War began because of the signing of the Non-aggression Treaty between Germany and the USSR on 23 August 1939 has nothing to do with history.

20,"The Red Army liberated Tallinn from fascists. After the liberation 75 objects with mines were discovered and 100 tonnes of explosives was removed. The fascists had placed mines in industry and government buildings, but also resident houses."
21,"The team of the President of Ukraine announced their intention to create a special service that will engage in ""cooperation with conscious citizens"" and process information received on the activities of local corrupt officials and persons who violate the territorial integrity of the country."
22,"Estonia is a tool in the hands of the EU and US. Because of the geographical location, they used Estonia and other Baltic states for pressuring Moscow through NATO expansion. There is no reason to mention equality in the relations between Tallinn and Brussels or Washington."
23,"Nowadays it's common to say that the Red Army bombed Tallinn. But actually they bombed the harbour where the enemy was and it's really close to the city. It has nothing to do with willful destroying, killing the citizens of the city."
24,"The leaders of the terrorist group Tahrir al-Sham, together with Members of the White Helmets, plan to conduct false flag attacks with chemical weapons, and the destruction of civil infrastructure, in the inhabited centers of the southern part of the Idlib de-escalation zone. The purpose of these false flag attacks is to accuse Syrian government forces of  using chemical weapons against civilians and of conducting indiscriminate attacks."
25,"It was here [a clip shows a bunker that was used by the opponents of the Syrian regime] where the White Helmets were shooting the fake video of the Syrian army allegedly using chemical weapons against civilians.

We are talking about the provocation with a fake chlorine attack on Khan Shaykhun. Then the White Helmets published a video, after which the Americans fired rockets at the Syrian airbase."
26,The destruction of war memorials and graves violates the 1993 treaty between Russia and the Czech Republic. It is especially shameful such things to occur on the basis of a political whim that has nothing whatsoever to do with the past. The aim of the situation with the statue of Marshall Konev is to induce hatred against Russia as part of a war psychosis aimed at provoking aggression against Russia.
27,"The U.S. [Air Force] Commander' statement about the seizure of Kaliningrad means that, in fact, US wants to capture Kaliningrad and exchange it for Crimea. All this may ultimately lead to a global nuclear conflict."
28,"Alltogether, the European Parliament's resolution is bewildering. The attempt to equalise the Victors over Fascism with the fascists is a blow against Europe itself, its unity and stability. Striking a blow on Communism, the European Parliament is desecrating the memory of their own heroes of the resistance, where the communists were represented in large numbers. Communists were the ones that suffered most during World War Two and in the pre-war period of Nazi dictatorship.

Striking a blow against one of the pillars of the fight against fascism, Europe automatically joins forces with Fascism and supports is reappearance, no matter which nice sounding slogans they are hiding behind."
29,The Estonian authorities pay tribute to their own heroes by laying flowers to Hitler’s Cross of Liberty. This monument is a copy of the emblem of the Estonian SS Legion – it was erected in the city centre ten years ago.

38,Russia is not allowed into Europe. Europe creates obstacles for full cooperation with Russia.
39,"Before the European Parliament starts equalising Stalinism and Nazism, it would have been a good idea to get things sorted out with the Nazism as such. Why is the resolution only condemning German Nazism? Why isn't it compared with, for instance, Nazism in the Baltic states: Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian.

The resolution was initiated by representatives of Lithuania, which brings the manipulation of facts to an entirely new level. Remember: as a result of the division of Poland, Lithuania got a sizable piece of its territory - the Vilnius area. If the non-aggression pact between USSR and Germany, also known as the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact, as was a criminal act; Lithuania was a direct beneficiary of this crime, performed 80 years ago.

44,"The drone attack on Saudi oil facilities was a false flag operation orchestrated by Saudi Arabia, Israel and US neo-conservatives close to former National Security Adviser John Bolton in order to sabotage US President Trump’s efforts to engage in dialogue with Iran."
45,"British news agency Reuters’ report on regional elections in Russia has ignored the overall result of United Russia, homing in on the party’s loss of a third of its seats in the Moscow city assembly. Reuters then contemplated a possible “beginning of the end” for Vladimir Putin, speculated on Putin’s downfall in the 2024 presidential elections and made an unwarranted comparison to Erdoğan’s election losses in Ankara and Istanbul.

Other influential Western media have furthered these false conclusions and presented Alexei Navalny as a hero of the elections, although he is a marginal figure in Russia and his only goal is to delegitimise the elections. Navalny actually avoided running both in the 2019 regional and 2018 Moscow mayoral elections (but this exposure in the West will certainly bring him new grants on account of working towards Putin’s alleged downfall)."

50,"In the European Union, they thought about creating their own unified army to confront the United States. The EU feels threatened by the Americans, says the report of the European Court of Auditors and the EU’s own army will be designed to protect it from all directions, especially the USA."
51,"The Dutch-led JIT's investigation alleges that the Boeing was shot down by a Buk anti-aircraft system belonging to Kursk's 53rd Russian anti-aircraft brigade. The Russian authorities not only provided radar data to the Netherlands, but also documentation that the Buk missile that hit the Boeing belonged to Ukraine, but the information was ignored by the investigators."
52,"The European Parliament has carried out a political hatchet job for Poland. On 13 October Poland is holding parliamentary elections, and most experts connect the signing of the European Parliament's resolution with the ""Acute Autumn Symptom"" of the Polish delegation to the EP. The current political leadership in Poland aims to demonstrate to the voters that they are defending the ""historical boundaries"" and fending off Russia."
53,"How could the members of the European Parliament sign a resolution, allowing the destruction of memorials, honouring the Soviet soldiers-liberators? The resolution is signed, it is not very surprising. The only way of preserving the memory of the fallen soldiers is to bring all the monuments to Russian territory, to stop the ""barbarians"" from desecrating the memories of generations.

Reading this opus, one cannot avoid remembering the Anti-Comintern pact that served as the foundation for the Berlin - Rome - Tokyo axis. The signing ""democrats"" of the European Parlament are, by the way, undeterred by this analogy.

55,"The main blow against Russia will be made in 2021, in connection with the parliamentary elections. There are no doubts whatsoever about it. All that is going on is just rehearsals. After all, the parade of the ""opposition"", ranging from professional ""protestutes"" against anything in the world, via seasoned clients of the US Embassy like Navalny and his crowd, to the freak-show of possessed shamans - all this are only the casting. An attempt to select those, who in two years will be transformed into ""great thinkers"" and, hence, moving the ""revolution"" forward; a revolution that finally, to the joy of Washington and its allies, will erase the Russian statehood from the face of the earth."

57,"Russian counter-sanctions affected EU fruit exports. Specialists note that the embargo, which Moscow was forced to impose in response to Western restrictions, led to losses of $170 million from sales of peaches and nectarines, and another $41 million from cherries. According to Russian experts, the European economy was significantly affected by the imposition of sanctions, while Russia received a boost to develop its own agricultural production."
58,"After the collapse of the USSR Poland revitalized the idea of Intermarium project, which foresees the creation of a buffer out of bordering states. Intermarium remains part of Polish domestic and foreign policies and illustrates its imperial ambitions. By attracting Ukrainian and Belarusian migrants, running a propagandistic campaign against Ukrainian and Belarusian governments and Russian world concept, Polish authorities aim to establish anti-Russian Intermarium and to feed animosities between the representatives of the [all-Russian] community.

Polish Giedroyc-Mieroszewski doctrine is still in place and envisages, among other things, weakening Russia by tearing Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and Caucasian countries away, pulling Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia in the EU and NATO, bringing cheap labour force from Ukraine and Belarus for the benefit of the Polish economy."
59,"Numerous Western politicians, US senators and congressmen, as well as French President Emanuel Macron, have accused Sputnik and RT of interfering in the US elections and elections in France, but have never provided evidence for their claims."
60,The UK's exit from the EU is the greatest victory of the Americans in the whole history of the EU. Britain and Poland are the US's right and left hands.
61,"Nowadays, Washington is playing the “religion card” in Georgia by primarily encouraging various Western religious groups to become more active in local communities. This is part of a carefully planned Western policy aimed at destabilising the environment in CIS and other countries where Washington is actively seeking to employ religion to meet its own needs shaped by public opinion in societies that are not yet under its control."
62,"Polish authorities were certain of signing an US-Polish agreement on the establishment of ""Fort Trump"" during the events of the 1st of September 2019. Poland hopes to become an Eastern European Britain. Then, as the most pro-American country, with US support, it could dictate to the rest of the EU what to do and how to do it. These hopes, however, did not come true."
63,"To cooperate with the US and Europe, all mainland Chinese companies have to run an office in Hong Kong. All money goes through Hong Kong and is controlled by Anglo-Saxon banks and elites. The gold and jewellery trades remain in their hands as before. This is what China disagrees with.

Hong Kong youth shout what others put in their heads. Protesters are already using Molotov cocktails. As soon as China applies force, the West will introduce sanctions. The UK is behind the protests in Hong Kong. China is in the spiderweb of the British empire.

No one will allow China with its present, pro-Russian, political position to develop. Over the years [the West] was preparing China for war with Russia and pumped China with competences and new industries. However, when Beijing refused to wage war against Russia, it was told: ""Alright, then we will deal with you""."
64,"The Bundeswehr and German NATO allies are actively optimising plans for operational deployment of the army against Russia. Furthermore, they are preparing a new command centre based in Ulm for a war against Russia.

67,"They call and promise (to join the European Union), but in fact they do not even expand relations in matters of duty-free trade. There are quotas for Ukraine’s account, which end from time to time ... Europe could help Ukraine economically, just allow them to enter its market. But it doesn’t. Europe hides behind a mythical position of agricultural standards."
68,"Rightly, they claim why Zelenskyy stands for sanctions. Of course, he will advocate sanctions. After all, sanctions are an initiative of the American Congress and the Senate. How can the President of Ukraine say no, when the American Congress, the European community speak of sanctions?"
69,"The West chose Russia as its main opponent after the collapse of the USSR.

The West today is divided on all major issues, and the only basis for unification is the anti-Russian issue. After the collapse of the USSR, suddenly the West no longer had a main opponent and chose Russia for this role. This is a pretext for them to maintain their military presence in different regions and to justify the network of their military bases."
70,In this way [by preserving the transit of gas from Russia to Europe via Ukraine] Europe is trying to guarantee 2 bln dollars of subsidies to Naftogaz which would help to avoid problems that might follow.
71,"Ukrainian experts and the government do not serve the interests of the Ukrainian people, they serve the American [energy] interest. The latter wants to sell liquefied gas, to worsen the situation in Europe and to put it on its knees using gas and political methods. And in order to accomplish this they have lit up Ukraine [with the Euromaidan revolution in 2013-2014] and have divided the European continent."
72,"The gas transmission system of Ukraine. It is an environmental disaster the world has not seen before. It is worse than Chernobyl because it emits extremely harmful substances into the environment. And these guys did not allow Russia to repair and clean it in due time.... This is a leaky pipeline, it is outdated and rusty, it is crumbling into dust. Even the most condescending environmental tender will say no to the [Ukrainian] gas transmission system."
73,Ukraine does not want to sign anything. They want problems in order to bring us to war.
74,"On 17 September 1939, the Red Army crossed the Polish border. By this time Polish troops had already been defeated by the Wehrmacht, while the Polish government fled abroad. Regardless of tensions between Moscow and Warsaw, the Red Army did not advance too deep, stopping at the ""Curzon Line"". This ethnic border between Poles, on one side and Ukrainians and Belarusians on the other, was established after the WWI and was supposed to become Eastern border of Poland. But Warsaw, taking advantage of the weakness of Soviet Russia after the civil war, occupied these territories.

Despite the commonly accepted myth that Poland fell victim of the collusion of two totalitarian regimes, the main satellite of Nazi Berlin in Eastern Europe was actually Warsaw. Poland was the first to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germans back in 1934.

The West also forgets that in 1938 Poland participated in the division of Czechoslovakia together with Hitler. The USSR as a response set an ultimatum that Moscow will annul existing non-aggression agreement. Thus, by crossing Polish borders in 1939, the USSR did not violate the international law of those times, unlike it is often being portrayed."
75,"G7 positions are based on the recognition of US global dominance. Canada and Italy do not have enough weight. US occupational military forces have remained in the territories of Japan and Germany since WWII. Both countries are not fully sovereign. UK and France have a very narrow avenue for taking international decisions beyond the US’s position. Hence, the G7 turned into a group of Soviet-like bureaucrats led by Washington. It has not much to discuss beyond European, American, or Japanese problems. Hence, Trump's statement to bring Russia back, as discussions about Ukraine, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, or global energy security are senseless without Moscow."
76,"Poland is not happy about deeper integration between Belarus and Russia. Poland still hopes to become the leader of New Europe. It follows the concept which puts forward the idea of Polish Prometheus, sympathising with all those willing to fight Russia."

79,"The isolated USSR had no alternative and had to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

The isolated Soviet Union had to act (...). It therefore subsequently entered into negotiations with fascist Germany. Moscow had ""no alternative"" and signed the non-aggression treaty with Berlin. All Soviet security interests had been taken into account in the secret additional protocol on the division of Poland. (...) The Soviet leadership had not given up and made further proposals, including a stand-by pact and a military treaty with Britain and France. But this had been rejected one by one and the talks with Moscow had been prolonged.

Since then, the events have repeatedly been used for accusations and allegations that the Soviet Union under Joseph V. Stalin had made common cause with fascist Germany under Adolf Hitler. (...) Historical events like these 80 years ago are also used in the current Western front position against Russia."
80,"Ondřej Kolář, who brought up the idea of removing the monument to Marshall Konev, Prague's liberator from the Nazis, is a junior city official of the Municipal District 6 in Prague with a few supporters. That means that this international row has been set up by a small clique of municipal clerks. No one outside the Czech capital had ever heard about Ondřej Kolář. His hatred towards all Russians is gigantic. These people are idiots."
81,The decision to remove the monument is an outrage and violates the obligations of the Czech Republic according to the 1993 agreement on amicable relations and cooperation.
82,"Prague was liberated after Berlin's fall. This was not a walk in the park. Konev's army was set in to the operation, 12,000 of our soldiers died, liberating Prague. The citizens of Prague erected the statue of Konev as a sign of gratitude. And suddenly some local guy, representing a borough, declares that the borough should take down the monument of the liberator and the saviour of the city. Some local kind of Gauleiter. Now Czech President Milos Zeman, a wise and educated man, has said that this is an outrage and this mustn't be done. We are, of course, grateful towards the President for his support. We hope that after this declaration, the [local] authorities will make the correct decision."
83,"It’s very bad that European countries do not understand where the USA’s thoughtless policy leads. Political elites in Europe either do not think about it or are influenced and patronised by American political elites to such extent that must just stupidly obey them.

It is an American tradition to fight by someone else’s hands and on someone else’s territory, if only the USA would not suffer, therefore Europeans act as cannon fodder here."
84,"Amnesty International, National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, Peace Corps, Carnegie Endowment, International Committee of the Red Cross, Heritage Foundation, Open Society Foundations and others are named “missionaries of the empire” for their obvious connections with the CIA and the US State Department."
85,"It is clear that the ECHR  makes all decisions based on its own, clearly expressed anti-Russian logic of behavior. It is naive to believe that they would suddenly begin to act somehow differently.
The ECHR has once again shown that this is not a court, but a bunch of swineherds in robes."
86,"A Swedish liberal, Magnus Soderlund, a professor of the Stockholm School of Economics has suggested “we should eat human flesh”. According to professor Soderlund, “conservative taboos could change over time if people simply tried eating human flesh”. The liberals have gone so insane that not eating human flesh is now considered “conservative” in their depraved libtard minds."
87,"Those forces in the West that made the Maidan coup possible are still in important positions. Through the military industrial complex, party bureaucracies, NGOs, think tanks and the media, they continue to exert great influence on government decisions; so even with frequent cabinet changes, politics remains constant. In some capitals, such as Berlin, the Maidan supporters are still in power.

These forces want to see Ukraine as a mono-ethnic country with EU and US affiliations and a nationalistic ideology influenced by Western Ukraine. In this scenario, the country should ideally be de-russified down to the last corner by bending and breaking."
88,"Since 2014, the West has targeted Russia with sanctions with the aim of slowing economic growth in order to create discontent among the Russian population, which should make a regime change possible."
89,The shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact is the best example of manipulation of history. It is important to remember the existence of the Pilsudski-Hitler pact signed in 1934 (Non-Aggression Pact between Poland and Germany). Signing of this pact gave Hitler time to re-equip his army.
90,"From a legal point of view, there were no grounds for withdrawing the status of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA because last year, the agency successfully passed WADA’s audits twice and it was recognised as one of the best in the world in its indicators. Therefore, RUSADA's status was temporarily suspended on a formal far-fetched pretext. All databases and test tubes were transferred back to WADA in early 2019. Further studies were conducted without a Russian presence, contrary to international legal procedures, which makes the decision illegal, unreasonable and requires an objective review by the International Sports Arbitration Court."
91,The decision of the European Court of Justice concerning the limitation of access to the OPAL pipeline was made in the interest of the United States; it may be changed when Europe faces shortages of gas during the winter period.
92,"Various Europeans are saying it; the Austrians, the Finns, the Germans: “the sanctions are bad, we need another approach. Let’s solve the problem with Donbas, but the sanctions are useless.” This is what all of Europe is saying."
93,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) proved that the concept of European rule of law is a hypothetical concept that does not exist in reality.

By rejecting an appeal against a landmark ruling that Soviet repressions against Lithuanian partisans can be treated as genocide, the ECHR is essentially rewriting the rule of law to fit the narrative that is being propagated in the mainstream media and diplomatic rhetoric in the last few months. It is similar to the recent attempts of rewriting history."
94,Pompeo and the US admit they want to involve in Romania's internal affairs. They admit that they put pressure on the political leaders so that they can do what they want.
95,"Human rights are quickly turning into a weapon that the US seeks to employ. According to a report, issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the US should make more efforts to protect human rights around the world and demonstrate leadership in this matter amid the strengthening of authoritarianism. It is likely that at least some of these recommendations would be followed through, namely the ones focused on Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. The ones focused on Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel, those can wait.

Of course, examples of Russia and China’s misadventures in supporting “authoritarianism” are presented. For Russia – participation in the Syrian conflict and assisting the legitimate government led by President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow is also accused of allegedly striking civilian targets. Moscow has repeatedly denied such allegations. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the Russian air forces take all the necessary precautions so as not to cause damage to civilian objects and civilians.

The ones who are mostly disregarding human rights and international law is, in fact, the US."
96,"Under NATO patronage, a joint military exercise, ‘Albanian Power 19’, is being held in Albania: It's participants are precisely those countries in the region that Pristina at several occasions in the past few months have summoned to unite against Serbia's policies.
Albanian, Croatian, Northern Macedonian, Montenegrin and Bulgarian forces, together with the so-called Kosovan Army, are practicing at the military base “Bize” in Albania under the patronage of US, UK, German, Italian, Turkish and Polish instructors.
There is no doubt that this is just the first proof in a row of formation of a pact against Serbia."
97,"The US destroyed the USSR through systematic indirect measures including blackmail, threats, mass protest actions and covert diplomacy. After the break-up of the USSR, the West's key concern became to preserve the post-Soviet space in a disintegrated form.

The Western capitals are very unhappy with the Union State between Belarus and Russia, which is the core of the reintegration process of the post-Soviet space.
The West, especially Washington and London, is extremely concerned about the creation of Great Russia (that is, the Russian Federation) and Belarus in the form of the Union State. It could become an example for the Little Russian (Ukrainian) people, tired of Russophobia and 'banderovshchina' [fascism,] and would put an end to the West's collective intentions to rule Northern Eurasia.

The main goal of the anti-Russian Western strategists of hybrid war in Ukraine and Belarus is to distort the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, to take away their Russian basis and replace it with Russophobia. Struck by the pathology of Russophobia, the Russian (Eastern) Slavs in Ukraine and Belarus slide into national betrayal and become Janissaries of the collective West. The West's goal is very clear: to destroy the Union state, to tear Belarus away from Russia and to turn Belarus into an anti-Russian buffer consisting of pro-Western semi-colonial states. They already include the Baltic countries, Ukraine, and Georgia."
98,"We must give credit to France for striving to establish a dialogue with Russia. Naturally, the Baltic states and Poland will throw a wrench into the process of normalising relations with Russia. They position themselves at the United States and no longer want to hear about anything else."
99,"Mass rallies in Ukraine in 2014 resulted in a violent coup d'état in Kyiv that forced President Yanukovych to flee the country. After that, the Crimean Peninsula left Ukraine and re-joined Russia, while Donetsk and Luhansk declared their independence and refused to obey the government in Kyiv."
100,"The 2016 Brexit referendum was not advisory in nature. The term ""advisory"" was created by Remainers to destroy and damage Brexit.

The politicians at the time said: ""We will carry out the express will of this vote."" There is nothing advisory about that."
101,"There are other regions in Ukraine willing to be part of Russia: Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia. All these cities are located in key economic areas."
102,"There has been a sharp increase in the number and intensity of NATO exercises around Russia's borders. These exercises are not separate from one another, but together comprise an encirclement strategy known as the ""anaconda ring."""
103,"Pre-revolutionary Russia prevented Britain from establishing its global dominance. Following the 1917 February Revolution and the end of Russian empire, Neville Chamberlain stated that one of the main goals of the WWI was achieved. Hence, while being nominally a Russian ally, Britain played a double game with the aim to eliminate Russian empire as a competitor to British global rule.

WWII was the continuation of this British policy, aimed this time at elimination of Soviet regime. Britain hated it because the USSR provoked national movements in British colonies. The goal of British empire and Anglo-Saxons was very clear, i.e. to eliminate the USSR through the Anti-Comintern Pact. British authorities including prime minister Chamberlain hated the USSR, to be clearer historical Russia, as much as Hitler did."

115,"The statement of the Estonian President that WWII ended for Estonia only in 1994, when the last Russian soldiers left this country, has no sense. If someone states that Estonia was occupied by the USSR, it means that Estonia was an ally of Nazi Germany."
116,"Western liberal thought now includes advocacy of cannibalism.

Speaking at a recent culinary conference in Sweden -- the widely recognized beacon of liberalism -- Stockholm-based academic Magnus Söderlund stated that ""the conservative taboo against cannibalism may change over time, if people simply try feeding on human flesh.""

The liberal professor said that cannibalism could be a means of fighting climate change, given that human flesh is much more environmentally friendly than beef."
117,The association agreement between Ukraine and EU proposed by Brussels was a deception that concealed the Obama administration's plans to separate Kyiv from Moscow [...]  and integrate Ukraine into NATO.
118,"Subject to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, just as they are written, integration with Russia is implied in the Minsk agreements, because there is a clause on cross-border cooperation. We are already moving within this framework."
119,"Lithuania should not boast of independence, as over the past three decades it has been following the same position as the EU, NATO and the United States."

122,"Zelenskyy was not able to discuss Crimea [during the Normandy summit], whose incorporation into Russia has therefore effectively been accepted by the EU. He has accepted the Steinmeier formula which Ukrainian nationalists hate because it forces Ukraine to grant decentralized federal status to Donetsk and Lugansk."
123,"


A Swedish professor of Applied Behavioral Science suggested that one should consider cannibalism and start eating human flesh. According to him, this could save the planet from climate change.

In an interview with TV4, Magnus Söderlund, professor emeritus and director of the Consumer Marketing Center at the Stockholm School of Economics, spoke in favour of a diet based on human flesh.

According to him, eating human flesh could help fight climate change if the global community accepted this idea. However, Söderlund indicates that the main obstacle to this proposal is the taboo surrounding the consumption of dead humans because most people are ""slightly conservative"" when it comes to eating foods they are not used to.

124,"No one pays attention to who works with whom. Deutsche Welle, BBC, Navalny, Venediktov and so on, all worked in unison. And this is perceived as normal. That is, there was an unprecedented level of foreign interference in Moscow City Duma elections."
125,In March 2014 Crimea became part of Russia as a result of a referendum.
126,In 2014 there was a coup d’état in Ukraine.
127,It is very interesting for geopolitics to see how a country as big as Russia controls the territory. In such a large country the electoral system must be adapted. [Russia has] chosen the technology to face this challenge. Russia is posing as a laboratory of digital democracy in the world nowadays.
128,"The Baltic countries have long been organising provocations against the Russian-speaking population living there to receive a reaction and then to immediately complain to Western allies about the “Russian threat”.

The promotion of a “Russian threat” helps the Baltic countries to achieve domestic and foreign political goals."
129,"When the US and EU introduced sanctions against Russia, they were so confident about their effectiveness that they began assuring each other about this. For instance, former US President Barack Obama stated that thanks to sanctions Russian economy ""is torn apart"". A few years after the introduction of sanctions the Russian economy is developing faster than the European one."
130,All accusations concerning Russia's meddling in the 2016 US presidential election are speculative. The Mueller report contains no proof of collusion.
131,"Not all of Serbia's neighbours are able to withstand external pressure. Despite the will of most citizens they are drawn into the North Atlantic Alliance's orbit with its fictional security guarantees.

132,"The goal of the US global “Anaconda” strategy is “to limit the living space of geopolitical opponents”, to provoke proxy wars and manipulate historical differences among regional players in South Caucasus."
133,"The US is operating a secret biological laboratory in Georgia, where it is developing its biological weapon. The biological threat might be hidden in food which is exported from Georgia to South Ossetia."
134,"The goal of the organizers of the [June 20 - 21] coup d’état in Georgia was to make Georgia an authoritarian, criminal, client state with American military bases which defies international law and to establish a new model of the government of former president Mikheil Saakashvili. The Georgian government has serious challenges since anti-Russian radicalism in Georgia is nurtured by Western grants and the US Democratic Party."
135,"UK's Brexit is not a special case as Brussels would like to think. Italy, Spain, Portugal, and possibly even France are in line to exit the EU. The UK is just a first, extreme manifestation of the trend which tears the EU apart from within. The UK is first to break apart because it was less attached to the EU integration mechanisms than the other EU countries.

The key EU problem is that it has never been integrated. Instead of equal cooperation between the EU countries, it had a hierarchy, the dominance of some countries and the subordination of others. Economic entities have never had equal conditions either. Instead, protectionism has been the case covered under the openness of economies.

Shameless curtail of economic freedoms accompanied by shouting about freedom of sexual and other minorities could be constrained with some generally accepted rules. However, the EU rules are imposed by a few grand countries, because the EU is a system of quotas and privileges. This dangerous mix could only lead to the present situation. The migrants issue became just a detonator to express general discontent."
136,"Sanctions against Russia are not meant to change its actions regarding Ukraine. Sanctions are geared to meddle in Russian internal affairs. They want to bring down the economic growth to zero, increase protests, mass demonstrations in Moscow, lower the ratings of the democratically elected popular President and create conditions for a coup - à la Russian Maidan."
137,"For approximately 250 years, the multi-faceted Zionist Rothschild crime family, with its prototypical Luciferian, anti-Christian, anti-religion, globalist aspirations, has tirelessly worked to intertwine and morph itself into the already existing global financial power structure as well as take over the helms of the mass brainwashing apparatus that we now call the controlled Western mainstream media.

138,The main goal of the US is to forward the conflict [in East Ukraine] on Russian borders.
139,"Private nationalist groups in Saudi who bitterly opposed foreign domination of their country could very well have financed and organized 9/11. But, of course, Washington could not admit this. That would have brought into question the US occupation of Saudi.

What’s also pretty clear is that Israel – at minimum – knew the attack was coming yet failed to warn its American ‘allies.’ Israel was the chief beneficiary of the 9/11 attacks – yet its bumbling Arab foes and bin Laden were blamed for this crime."
140,"The Ukrainian Parliament presented its Draft National Budget for 2020. The almost two times increase of the country’s military budget was announced at a briefing by Minister of Finance Oksana Markarova. The increase in defense is clearly aimed at ramping up preparations for an aggressive war. This goes directly in contrast with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s claims that Ukraine currently wishes for normalization of the situation in Eastern Ukraine.

If peace was the aim, why would so much investment be needed in defense, especially when the country clearly has no funds, judging by the rumors of yet another IMF loan?

Furthermore, the announced “disarmament” of the Nazi-infested “volunteer battalions” left them with half their weapons in place, and it became apparent that they weren’t withdrawn from the frontline as it was suggested earlier."
141,The West continues to hide information. The international investigation group just continues to ignore important details that point to a series of explosions on board MH17.
142,Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe breaks ties with Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarchate Constantinople [has] de facto turned into a tool of supporters of the New World Order. The destructive position of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in such regions as Ukraine and the Balkans are a visible example of this.
143,"The US leadership is carrying out active diplomatic, economic (including sanction pressure) and propaganda campaigns against Russia. The US-NATO military build-up is ongoing along Russian borders in Eastern and Northern Europe. The US and its allies are openly backing the so-called ‘non-system opposition’ in Russia (the part of the opposition that openly aims to overthrow the government by non-constitutional means and destroy the Russian statehood). This ‘opposition’ includes various radicals and destructive forces that employ methods and tools that have been already demonstrated in Ukraine in 2013-14."
144,Constantinople that struggles to keep its influence across the Orthodox World has become a useful tool for forces interested in the destruction of traditional religious systems in Europe. Together with supporters of the neoliberal globalist dystopia it is currently backing various non-canonical entities in the Balkans and Eastern Europe to achieve their own political goals.

148,"Despite the Russian help, the Ukrainian leadership created a new nuclear graveyard right near Kyiv. This facility may lead to a new Chernobyl disaster in the future. The new nuclear graveyard impedes the development of the exclusion zone as a tourist route and forever assigns to it the status of a radiation-dangerous territory. In the future, the nuclear graveyard can store radioactive waste from European countries."
149,"In Ukraine, gas prices are too high. The only way for the country not to freeze this winter is to urgently conclude gas supply contracts with Russia (Gazprom)."
150,The reunification of the Crimea with Russia took place after a referendum in March 2014. 96.77% of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea and 95.6% of the inhabitants of Sevastopol voted in favour of joining the Russian Federation.
151,"9/11: The WTC7 building was blown up professionally.
The study (...) does not focus on the collapse of the 400-metre-high twin towers WTC1 and WTC2, but on the case of the much lower WTC7, which was not rammed by an aircraft. Nevertheless, the 186-metre-high tower collapsed in just seven seconds. (...) The WTC7 building was most likely blown up professionally."
152,"Before joining NATO, Georgia should recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is impossible to enter NATO with territorial disputes. Rasmussen suggested a very simple thing to Georgia - give up South Ossetia and Abkhazia, recognize their independence and then we [NATO] will be ready to discuss your membership."
153,"We appreciate the prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, but there are some issues. The Ukrainian sailors, who are war criminals, were kindly released by Russia, but have officially confirmed that are ready to go through the Kerch Strait again. It was an aggressive violation of Russian borders."
154,"Trump might punish Zelenskyy for not fulfilling his demands by several means, including taking the IMF money back. Thus, Ukraine is not an independent state since its president is a hostage to American domestic politics."
155,"The biggest danger to Europe is the restoration of the USSR. Preventing this is the priority of German, French, American and other political forces. Western countries have a genetic fear of Russia's strengthening and thereby provoke one conflict after another."

The West is not helping Syrian refugees to return home as it channels large sums of money, like 7 billion euros allocated at the Brussels conference on supporting Syrian refugees, to refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. By doing so the West is trying to keep as many refugees as possible in camps outside Syria in order to influence how they vote in elections."

186,"The US and EU do not need independent Belarus. Instead they need anti-Russian Belarus, similar to fascist Ukraine. The US and the EU dream about anti-Russian scenario in Belarus like the one they implemented in Ukraine in 2014. Westerners understand well that talks about the peace-making role of Belarus in Europe or about Belarus as European country is a good chance to tear Belarus away from Russia in order to to wage a war against Russia and multipolar global order not only from Ukraine but from the Belarusian territory too."
187,"NATO enlargement is the main problem in relations between Russia and Europe. Had the Alliance not expanded, there wouldn’t have been problems with Ukraine and Georgia. "
188,"The procedure to extend the sanctions requires a unanimous vote, i.e. if one EU member state votes against the continuation of sanctions, they will be lifted. Such a possibility is quite realistic given the current mood in Europe, which is mostly constructive towards Russia.

190,"Throughout 1938-1939, the Soviet military functionaries assumed that the most probable security threat for the USSR came not only from a military union of Germany and Italy, but also from Poland, which appeared in the “orbit” of the Nazi block. Thus, the USSR had to be prepared for a fight on two fronts – in the West (against Germany and Poland) and in the East (against Japan)."
191,In Syria and northern Iraq there is evidence about the first stages of the emergence of ISIS in 2003 and 2005. The Americans do not want this evidence to fall into the hands of others because it illustrates the participation of Saudi Arabia and [...] American and non-American private bodies in the first stage of the establishment of the Islamic State. The Americans are creating chaos in certain places to allow special forces to enter and evacuate the evidence from the area.
192,"American authorities intentionally terminated the INF treaty under the pretext that Russia violated the agreement. However, Moscow rejects all allegations. The test of the forbidden rocket proves that the Americans sought to terminate the agreement.

193,"If we recall all the actions of Britain in the 1930s, it is likely that Boris Johnson is not happy with the outcome of the WW2. Because they all planned to profit from Russian territories. Therefore, today they want to revise the history, to show everyone how bad Russia is and how good democrats and liberals are. Historical distortions are an integral part of Western policy. "
194,"In 1941 attack of the Soviet Union Adolf Hitler was accompanied by multi-national forces, which can be named the European Union. The WWII was a point after which Europe stopped its existence as an independent actor on international stage. Americans not only made a fortune and solved all their domestic problems but also removed annoying competitors, i.e. the satellites of Hitler's Germany, the so called European Union, and the UK.

200,"There is now more ambiguity and contradictions in the case of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, calling on London to answer the questions previously raised by the Russian side. [...] The political version of the incident presented by the United Kingdom was not credible, because there were many ambiguities and contradictions in the case. "
201,"Ukraine continues to be confident that the West will always unconditionally support any Russophobic regime. The country simply entrusted the definition of its foreign and security policy to the West. Moreover, Ukraine has created a situation whereby external forces dictate to it exactly how it should solve its internal problems."
202,"The US with its close allies supported an unconstitutional and armed coup d'état in Ukraine, in February 2014, when the Ukrainian opposition, under pressure from radicals and neo-Nazis, broke the agreement signed by EU members."
203,"The Green New Deal being spread by London bankers like Mark Carney and Prince Charles which is really just another name for de-population.

This is the program which China and Russia have rejected under the emerging global framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. China is planning to triple its nuclear sector by 2032 to power its vast growth program and Russia’s ambitious nuclear energy program is tied directly to Putin’s recent decision to challenge the Liberal Malthusian order by name. Any nation committed to raising the living standards and productive powers of its people cannot tolerate a de-carbonisation or de-nuclearisation plan for even a minute."
204,"Ukrainians are saying they are fighting Buriats, where are they? None could be seen in the prisoner swap. Where are enlisted Russian soldiers? We are in fact exchanging some Ukrainians for others - it is after all a civil war. Zelenskyi got rid of Ukrainians he did not want, by sending them to what local idiots call ""Mordor"" - Russia.

Ukrainians have not returned a single Russian soldier,  because there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine."
205,"Americans established a new type of colonialism which is called NATO. NATO is an empire reborn, but the nations within it do not realize under whose command they are."
206,"Western media have kept mostly silent about the role of neo- and classical Nazi groups in the Maidan and the war in Eastern Ukraine, choosing to airbrush them out of the narrative about “Russian aggression” they have created.

The ultra-nationalists brought Petro Poroshenko to power."
207,"Tensions since the end of the USSR come from Moscow. It is the United States that are literally colonising Poland.
Everyone knows geography. There is natural gas that costs less. Yet the Poles - for some reason - buy the gas ten times farther than where it is produced in an abominably anti-ecological way in the United States and which is much more expensive. They are literally forced to buy American equipment. There is also an over-presence of US military forces. The Poles, unfortunately for them, were under Soviet influence and now they are under the influence of the United States."
208,"Ukraine is releasing to Russia mainly Ukrainian citizens from East Ukraine, which means that Kiyv should not be offended by those who call events in Ukraine civil war. De facto this is the case, we [Russia] are receiving  participants of the civil war. The prisoner swap legally confirms that."
209,"Kyiv unleashed the war in Donbas, immediately after the Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence.


"
210,"Historical documents newly released by Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs show that the Soviet Union decided to sign the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with Nazi Germany for two reasons: the aggressive foreign policy of Poland, which prevented a Soviet alliance with France and the United Kingdom, and fears of an eventual Polish-German military alliance that would pose a really serious threat to the USSR."
211,"The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which does not include Russia, despite the latter’s willingness to provide valuable data regarding the incident including radar readings, has ignored crucial evidence supplied by Moscow."
212,What Russian forces? Where is at least one exchanged soldier? You have been talking so much how you are at war with mighty Russia! Where are the hundreds and thousands captured Russian soldiers?
213,"The term ""conspiracy theory"" is itself part of a broader conspiracy against the truth. The term ""conspiracy theory"" was invented by a Jewish professor at the university of Vienna, Karl Popper, who is the creator of the open society theory. His best student George Soros, whose real name is Schwartz, is the enforcer of the conspiracy aiming to label all those who speak the truth as conspiracy theorists."
214,"The US administration, by creating the US Space Command and planning to create a Space Force (a sixth branch of the military), is attempting to militarize outer space in violation of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,  which prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in space and on celestial bodies."
215,"Johnson Yeung Ching-yin, one of the leaders of the Hong Kong protests, is a fellow of the US National Endowment of Democracy, NED. The supposed NGO he works for in turn works hand-in-hand with US and UK-based fronts involved in supporting Hong Kong’s current unrest and a much wider anti-Beijing political agenda. The direct ties and extreme conflicts of interest found under virtually every rock overturned when critically examining the leadership of Hong Kong’s ongoing unrest all lead to Washington. They also once again reveal the Western media as involved in a coordinated campaign of disinformation – where proper investigative journalism is purposefully side-stepped and narratives shamelessly spun instead to frame Hong Kong’s ongoing conflict in whatever light best suits US interests."
216,The international team that is investigating the circumstances of the MH17 accident has presented only provisional results.

223,"Climate activists, world leaders, and the complicit Western media have been quick to link the ongoing Amazon wildfires to man-made climate change and the apocalyptic environmental consequences of human activity. They have even blamed the pro-industrial policies of Brazilian President Bolsonaro for accelerating the Amazon's demise.

Although studies show that the global occurrence of wildfires is dropping and that human activity has actually helped offset their impact on global climate, environmental campaigners and politicians continue to insist that only the imposition of a benevolent green dictatorship can save our planet from destruction. The Green New Deal, for instance, calls for the abolition of all air travel and stipulates government-overseen wealth redistribution programs beyond anything the communists of the 20th century could dream of."
224,"Western support in certain issues is key, for example in the non-recognition policy. However, the West points out that Georgia should not have any more expectations. It is not allowed to supply Georgia with lethal weapons. Although they recognise that Georgia is an occupied country and that Georgia needs weapons to defend itself from the occupiers, they still do not supply Georgia with weapons – they even do not sell them, not to mention giving them for free."
225,"The statement about the 'nuclear death risk' for Lithuania posed by the Belarusian nuclear power plant, made by Lithuanian politician Vytautas Landsbergis, is designed to create a negative image of the Russian nuclear energy sector. It also intends to hurt Belarusian-Russian energy cooperation. Lithuania expects to tear Belarus away from Russia and integrate it into the Western electricity network. Such anti-Russian statements are very characteristic of Lithuanian politics as its state policies make Lithuania one of the most Russophobic countries."
226,"Vilnius is working on the creation of an international coalition against the Belarusian nuclear power plant. Earlier, Lithuania had to shut down its nuclear power plant at the EU's request, so a situation in which neighbouring Belarus has built a new nuclear power plant offends Lithuania."
227,"NATO, led by the US, is closing in on Russia's borders, constantly pushing the infrastructure forward. The alliance's forces have thoroughly taken control of the territory of the Baltic States and Poland. Now they are also trying to settle in Ukraine."
228,"The US introduced new sanctions against Russia in relation to the Skripals' poisoning. London was quick to declare Russia's responsibility for the accident. The Russian authorities denied their involvement, offered investigative assistance to the UK and demanded consular access to Skripal's daughter. All official Russian requests were ignored by the UK. The UK's laboratory in Porton Down disproved that the poisonous substance was produced in Russia."
229,"The goal of John Bolton's visit to Ukraine was to pull it into a full-scale war. The Americans need a full-scale war.

The Americans are in full control of the situation and allow ""vampires"" from the Ukrainian side to make money in this local war. That's why they build bio-labs, where they kidnap people, sell their organs. They earn from human trafficking, drug and arms trade. Americans allow all of this to happen and when it becomes necessary they will unleash this horde on Donbas. Their goal is a full scale war in Ukraine."
230,Abkhazia and Samachablo were not parts of Georgia until the October Revolution and the first years of Soviet rule. A forced “Georgianisation“ policy was carried out there.
231,"Celebratory events devoted to the outbreak of World War II were held in Poland. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) decided to use this important date for a political demonstration and hold an informal summit of the leaders of Western democracies. The government of Poland decided not to invite the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and it resulted in a failure of their ‘genius’ plan: none of the leaders of Europe, the United States, China, Japan, other countries of Asia-Pacific, Belarus, Armenia, or other countries of the post-Soviet space attended the celebrations. However, presidents of Ukraine and Georgia did fly to Warsaw."
232,"The 35 for 35 prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia once again revealed the two-faced stance of the so-called ‘Civilized World’ towards the MH17 tragedy in eastern Ukraine. Ahead of the prisoner swap, the Netherlands urged Ukraine to not hand over Vladimir Tsemakh to Russia.

By this move, the Netherlands admitted that it is not a neutral side and is not interested in an objective investigation of the MH17 tragedy. The Dutch side had a lot of time to question the supposed witness. However, this was not enough and it wanted the person to remain in Ukraine, where Tsemakh would be subjected to constant physical and psychological pressure. The Dutch government, which is allegedly a neutral side in the MH17 case, is de facto impeding the objective investigation of the tragedy.

233,Ukraine’s political goal remains the same – war with Russia.
234,"It is not true that the Americans don't want Russia to sell gas to Europe. On the contrary, the US is interested in purchasing gas from Russia to resell it at a high price."
235,"The Polish leadership continues to follow the principles of anti-Russian politics, not inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin to commemorative events dedicated to the outbreak of World War II.

He also confessed to assassinating Princess Diana after being instructed to do so by Prince Philip.
"
245,"NATO is behind the decision not to invite Russia to the commemorations of the beginning of the Second World War.

A classic campaign has taken place there. This was carried out according to curricula drawn up in advance by NATO. All this is an information campaign and it had an absolutely unsightly, very dangerous break in Warsaw.

The commemoration ceremony in Warsaw is a colossal fake that goes beyond the bounds of what is permitted […] The events in Warsaw were announced as events to mark the beginning of the Second World War, but have turned into a classic campaign to rewrite history and disinformation. The mass media generally had nothing to do with it.

249,"As an anti-human society and a capitalist state the US is a maddened community, which constantly generates degraded politicians. Mass shootings in the US mean that the US is one large madhouse. The very acceptance of American dream turns a human into a maddened person. The same is true for the US ruling elite. Isn't State Secretary Mike Pompeo, who states that Crimea belongs to banderovtsy [Ukrainian fascists] not a mentally ill politician? US President [former] advisor John Bolton's face indicates his absolute degradation. Isn't Donald Trump, who withdrew from the INF Treaty, a mentally ill politician, too?

In the countries like the US and Poland where a lot of spoken about love towards God, the key object of worship is Mammon [a term from the Christian Bible used to describe material wealth or greed]. Tadevush Kondrasevich, the Belarusian Roman Catholic Archbishop, would not acknowledge this with his anti-Soviet and Russophobic worldview. In fact, Belarusian independent media and experts are mentally ill people too, just like Crusius, Trump, or Duda. If these people come to power, they would stage as big bacchanalia as mentally ill 'banderovtsy', Kaczynski brothers, and racists in Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states, all servile puppets of the mentally ill uncle Sam."
250,"The formation of the new Ukrainian cabinet was approved by US President adviser, John Bolton. Hence, it will not be allowed to develop closer relations with Russia. Ukraine's external governance remains in place. A whole floor at Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) building is occupied by Americans. The US State Department and US Embassy in Ukraine represent a system of ""Gauleiters""; a super-structure, controlling the Ukrainian state. US gave instructions to former President Petro Poroshenko and Ukraine has not got rid of this.
However, the US does not need the project of ""Ukraine as an Anti-Russia"" anymore. The project is being decommissioned. Still it is premature to believe that Ukraine will soon get rid of external control. Ukraine's economic crisis was imported from the US. External actors extract Ukrainian human and financial resources to mitigate their own economic crises. How is it that Ukrainians believed that Russia was responsible for economic difficulties in 2014? Soviet people of slavonic origins, born in Little Russia."
251,"The Soviet Union was forced to sign a pact with Hitler after several attempts to solve the problem with Western countries in a diplomatic way and after trying to make an agreement with Poland. At the same time, the West were helping Hitler by directing him toward the USSR.

The content of the agreement was very simple - the two sides agreed to not attack each other for the next 10 years. Secret protocol regulated the distribution of spheres of influence in Poland. The USSR was given only the territory that was previously occupied by Poland after the First World War. These are western Ukraine and western Belarus.

255,"The German media and NATO portray Russia as an enemy.

Only recently the claim: “Russian secret service possibly involved in murder of exiled Georgian” was to be read in Hamburg's “Spiegel”. The murderer was also called a “suspect”. The article is teeming with “should” and “possible”. As almost always when it comes to the Russians, the subjunctive triumphs over journalism.

This latest campaign, one of the many, many in a constant fire of suspicion against “the Russians”, raises the question of who will benefit from it. (...) NATO, Trump (...) need the enemy for the turnover of their friends in the economy and for political power: Nothing makes voters dumber than an evil enemy image.

The US will try to rebuild relations on the basis of a senior partner's relation to a junior.

257,"The commemorative events on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in Warsaw show that, even after the Charter of Paris of November 1990, no one wants an understanding with Russia because Russia is denied its rightful place at the common ""European table"". (...) The way the event in Warsaw is organised betrays peace for Europe.

Russia is not invited to Warsaw on 1 September 2019. Others are invited, although the American ambassador in Warsaw in 1939 did not pass on his knowledge of the Stalin-Hitler Pact to the Polish government. (...) They wanted the war under all circumstances, and yet they are invited prominently.

&nbsp;"
258,"Yes, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained a Secret Protocol that divided Poland in two. However, if Germany had not attacked Poland, the Protocol would have become void.

So, the facts say that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was an additional argument for Hitler that did not alter his decision. If we imagine that this pact between Germany and the USSR had not been signed, the German-Polish war would have started in any case because of the deadlock in the mutual relations.

The Americans establish their strike groups or bases for deployment with the peoples of other countries as human shields according to a murderous algorithm. Primarily relying on the corruption of the political elites of these countries.

His murder was the first in the coup d’etat which led to the murder not only of the Imperial Family, but to the murder of millions, the attempt to murder Civilization, to murder the Christian Empire. This murder was carried out by the Anglo-Zionist Empire and bankers like the Rothschilds and the Warburgs. This Anglo-Zionist Empire has reigned for 100 years now."
262,"Former Verkhovna Rada deputy, Alexey Zhuravko, published documents that testify to the crimes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces against the civilian population of the Donbas. Reported cases are dated from 2014-2015 and addressed to the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Stepan Poltorak. According to experts, information about the crimes of the Ukrainian military in the east of the country has become public knowledge more than once.

No single liberal media has stated how the Soviet Union sharply criticised Germany’s aggressive actions in Europe since 1938 and repeatedly tried to agree on a working treaty to counter German aggression. Nevertheless, England and France refused to take on specific obligations in the event of a German attack on any European state, thereby excluding the possibility of reaching such an agreement.

268,The World War II was ordered by the US in order to defeat Britain. Hitler was an Anglophile and London secretly supported the consolidation of German Army. One day Poland was doomed to become the subject of bargaining between Berlin and London. But London was full of contradictions; it supported Poland and the US used the geopolitical situation to provoke a clash between the European forces.
269,"Negotiations in Beslan would have been futile. The terrorists never formulated their demands clearly, only mentioned the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and the independence of the region.

At 13h, 3rd of September 2004, an explosion was heard, and terrorists opened fire. The origin of the explosion remains obscure until today. It forced Spetsnaz to instantly make the decision to attack.

Among the terrorists were many Ingush trained in the separatist republic. There were also identified British nationals of Algerian origin, as well as funding from Saudi and Kuwaiti nationals, de facto internationalising the cell. In December 2006, the State Duma Commission noted that the terrorists were responsible for the initial explosion.

When people really want to protest, they do it like the football fans in 2002 - with violence. Or like in the 1991. And, for example, the Soviet people protested in silence."
271,"The US decision to impose a second round of sanctions against Russia over the Skripal poisoning was the result of pressure by powerful forces in the US which are against the normalisation of relations with Russia for political domestic reasons, and because US elections are approaching, while Trump seeks instead to improve relations with Russia."

The dream of the Western warmongers will come true next spring (during NATO military exercises). Just in time for the Moscow celebrations for the end of the war in 1945, the tank engines will roar across Germany and past Dresden to the east. It will be a march against Russia as the world has not seen it since the ""Operation Barbarossa"". The people in Russia must gain the impression that the Second World War is to be fought further during the NATO large-scale manoeuvres before the anniversary of the end of the war in 1945.

The impeachment proceedings against the American President Trump are proceeding exactly according to this timetable pattern. This is for conspiracy practitioners. The roadmap for this trial is designed to prevent President Putin and President Trump from meeting in Davos at the end of January 2020 and possibly discussing in private things that could work against the war interests of the ""deep state"". It is enough for the Washington warlords to imagine that President Trump could do without an interpreter from the US State Department's resistance nest. The entire absurdity of Western and, above all, NATO policy lies in this notion. There goes a presidential candidate named Trump and declares to strive for good relations with Russia."

Although the pretended reason of obeying NATO and US' policy is countering the ""Russian threat"", in reality Romania, the Baltic states, and Poland are using the US to counter Western Europe."
288,"Following the meeting with Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron published a post in Facebook calling Russia ""a deeply European country"" and hoping to see Europe ""extending from Lisbon to Vladivostok."" However Macron's acceptance of Russia into Europe is not a reason for joy. In fact, present-time Russia is more European than France. It is Moscow who defends European traditions and a high level of European culture, not Paris.

The EU replaced ancient European fundamental traditions with a cocktail of liberalism, feminism, LGBT-activism and anti-European leftist rhetoric.The present-time EU values are not European values but their negation.

The doctrines of tolerance and multiculturalism are also an attack against European heritage. The less valuable aspects of Western culture such as scientific achievements, comfort, and liberalism are triumphing, whereas its core values, that is Christianity, European individualism, the rule of law, intellectual freedom, and high culture are undermined.

Traditionalists and Eurosceptics look at Russia with hope and take Vladimir Putin as Messiah. Therefore, who has to accept whom into Europe is an open question."

292,"WADA's decision to exclude Russia from major sports events is anti-Russian hysteria. The exclusion of the country from all major sporting events in the next four years is part of a campaign directed against Russia.

Otherwise, Ukraine will turn not only into a degrading, decaying country but a real anti-Russia full of Russophobia, a source of constant terrorist threat for both Russia and Belarus."
316,"The problem is that there are too many similar initiatives in our country that [...] have only one goal: to suppress all the information coming from Russia from the information field and replace it with their own, to make people consume only one information product and build their understanding of the world only in accordance with it.

Journalists who report objectively are declared as ineligible in order to open up space for propaganda and placement of various half-truths.

333,"The US government has compelled Twitter and Facebook to take down pages and accounts that allegedly “spread disinformation” about current protests in Hong Kong in order to censor views that are critical of dominant Western narratives about these protests.

Beginning in 2016, Western governments used allegations about “state-induced disinformation campaigns” and imaginary “Russian interference” in order to discredit opinions that question Western narratives as “threats to liberal democratic values”. Social media companies were pressured by the US and other Western governments to censor critical views and preserve the West’s media monopoly. This strategy, first applied to Russia, is now being applied to China and the Hong Kong protests."
334,"At present Belarus and Russia actively work on a joint strategy for closer integration. Belarus is the closest Russian ally and its strategic partner.

342,"RT and Sputnik are prevented from appearing in briefings and some internet software programmes are invented to automatically ban those reports deemed politically unacceptable by the authorities of the country concerned. This is a violation of OSCE obligations regarding direct access to public information [...] The Russian authorities have not taken restrictive measures against foreign media.
The situation of the Russian media in the West has become difficult in recent years. The European Parliament has adopted a resolution indicating the need to confront Russian media, where Sputnik and RT were identified as major threats [...] The adoption of such a document signals the apparent deterioration of ideas about democracy in Western society."
343,The hitherto policy of the Polish authorities towards Ukraine has been characterised by ambiguity. It will not be a problem for Poland to turn away from the friendly position towards Ukraine if Washington gives such a signal.
344,Strong and independent Georgia is not in the interests of the West. If Georgia was truly free we would not have to listen to and obey neither the US ambassador nor the EU.
345,"The Georgian Ministry of Education signed an agreement with three different UN committees according to which human rights, gender equality, healthy life and reproductive health (a.k.a sex education) will be taught in schools. Psychologists warn us that sex education at an early age leads to earlier sex lives, abortions, impotence, and teenage pregnancy. In addition, it causes a decline in intellect and creative skills as well as to a psychological inability to engage in marital life and inclination to homosexuality."

347,"The Eastern Partnership's aim is to promote the so called European values in Belarus and other EaP countries. Hence, it aims at eroding their identities and replacing their national histories with EU and NATO views. As for Belarus, the Eastern Partnership initiative plans to replace all-Russian history with the version of history elaborated by the Polish gentry.

The Eastern Partnership initiative is a 'Trojan horse,' which was constructed by chauvinistic Polish circles in order to crack the civilisational foundation of  Belarusian society. It is a noose on the Belarusian statehood placed there by Poland. The latter plans to take over western Belarus as was boldly voiced by Polish president Andrzej Duda in 2015 in relation to western Ukraine.

348,"The president, prime minister, defence minister, and others have been deceiving the public when they state that NATO empowers Georgia. NATO does not strengthen Georgia stronger; NATO just prepares the country for its own tasks."
349,"Moldova, as well as other countries in the neighborhood, is a ""hostage"" of the Pentagon and NATO.

Positioning the American missile defense system in the Romanian town of Deveselu represents a direct threat to Russia, with foreseeable negative consequences for the security of Romania and its neighbors, including Moldova.
"
350,"The EU has not yet come to the point when it begins to crumble, but its expansionist policy has reached its limits. To overcome this deadlock, the EU hopes to take over the Russian market. The US and UK have clearly placed their bets on a Russian Maidan. The EU also favours this idea but acts more cautiously. Hence, the EU and its ruling elites, the German financial elite in particular, are Russia's enemies.

In order to keep going, the EU has to expand to the East and to conquer new territories. This is why it has fought fiercely to keep Ukraine in its orbit. By taking over Russian partner states (Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, etc.) the EU intends to demonstrate to its own citizens that it is a developing machine. Expansionism and takeover of the new living space aim at looting wild Eastern lands. According to EU logic, Belarus should be ruined just as Ukraine was."
351,"The current state of the Ukrainian state has been the laughingstock of the entire Europe and the tragedy for people living in this territory. Recently, the Kiev government has released a new batch of nationalistic fairy tales. ""The desire for independence is embedded in our [Ukrainian] genetic code,” the Ukrainian President noted.

It would be interesting to know what kind of ‘genetic links’ to the Ukrainian nation does the ethnically Jewish president have?

&nbsp;"
352,"Nowadays, Western civilisation headed by the US aims at establishing a new world order. It envisages to have a 'golden billion' and the rest of the world's population will turn into poor people deprived of everything including a vote.

In pursuit of windfall-profits, multinational corporations provoke national and religious conflicts, destabilise international security and doom all countries to social and moral degradation. Most countries and peoples on Earth are invariably mere suppliers of raw materials to a small group of the most developed countries and multinational corporations.

Belarus faces hoax terrorist threats from time to time, which cause damage to the state budget and social infrastructure. Who benefits? All those who need the destabilisation of Belarus, that is foreign organisations pursuing aggressive policies towards Belarus and the Belarusian 'fifth column', the so-called democratic opposition."

355,The Polish government insists on relocating an additional contingent of US troops to its territory because of the desire to strengthen its influence in Eastern Europe through the myth of Russian military aggression.
356,"Denmark got frightened after it turned out that Donald Trump was not joking about his intention to purchase Greenland. Trump is not the type of person who can easily be told 'no'. A catastrophic perspective lies ahead of Denmark as it is one of the US’s allied countries. For them, Trump's initiatives are offers which cannot be refused. Why would Trump pay for something that he can get for free or for a symbolic price? This would be a shame for such a successful businessman as Donald Trump.

Therefore, Trump can get Greenland by arguing that as a NATO member, Denmark did not pay a penny for its military security. Hence, either Denmark pays billions of dollars for the security provided to it by the Americans over the last 70 years, or it gives up Greenland to the US. This development was logical given that the US does not really have allies as claimed but the vassal states which Washington can bend at any time. They will become victims of American global dominance. If Trump dared to ask Russia to sell its Sakhalin island, the Kremlin could launch a hyper-sonic missile at the White House."

358,"At present, it is as hard for the West to ""sell"" G8 membership to Russia as it was impossible to ""sell"" Ukraine to Russia after the 2014 coup. This does not mean Russia did not really want to get it. Russia just asked for concrete terms of the deal whereas the West wanted to have its hands free.

For Moscow, it was inconceivable a decade ago to put in question the need to take part in the G8, whereas today, this is reality. Back in the 1990s, Moscow had to seek the West's favour. At present, the West needs Russia as it has turned into a global leader. Without Russia's membership, any organisation including the Council of Europe cannot pretend to have European or global status."
359,"The refusal of Poland to allow Soviet troops to pass through its territory in 1939 was a mistake by the Polish authorities. The USSR could not wait until the German troops appeared on the Soviet borders and started a war against the Soviet Union from the surroundings of Minsk. Thus, if Poland realised a rational policy (based on its national interests), it would have been treated differently by the Soviet Union."
360,"In 1939, the “ideal scenario” assumed by the UK authorities at the beginning of the war between Germany and the USSR was the partition of Poland, which was sacrificed by the UK to inspire a conflict between Stalin and Hitler. In this situation, the UK would have been able to present itself as a peace-making force, increasing its influence in Europe. Although, this “UK schedule of war” was thwarted by Hitler, who forced Stalin to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and attacked France instead of the USSR."
361,"The American military base in Poland is very important for the USA, but not necessary at all for the Polish interests. Poland finances 100% of the costs of this base – it means that the Polish state pays 100% of the costs to achieve US strategic goals in the region. Poland helps the USA to play its geopolitical game increasing the pressure at Russia."
362,Poland is a country with the highest social inequality in the European Union. This situation causes political problems as the poorest people rarely vote (so they are excluded from political life).
363,Polish policy towards Russia is entirely based on the support of the United States.
364,"The sole purpose of the United States was to cover up the work carried out in violation of the INF Treaty. The initial intention - to get out of it. The US launched a propaganda campaign about Russia’s non-compliance with the treaty. Moscow previously had information about the US development of weapons prohibited by the treaty.

American emissaries attempt to influence Russian internal policies through the oligarchy."
367,"

The West interfered in Ukraine in 2014, leading to a Nazi coup d’état in the country.

For all these years the German government has been claiming ‘The West did not interfere in Ukraine in 2014’; ‘Right-wing extremists there had no influence’ and ‘The fall of President Yanukovych was not a coup d’état’. But these claims are false.

While the German government claimed in 2015 that foreign powers had played no role in the change of power in Ukraine in 2014, this was not only untrue but obscured the fact that Germany itself was very much involved in the preparation and implementation of the coup in Kyiv through its Embassy and cooperation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the media, and German politics, as well as with Vitali Klitschko. And even after the forced change of Government, Germany still cooperated with right-wing radical groups against anti-Maidan groups.

"
368,"Hong Kong has turned into a Western 'Trojan horse' in China. American security bodies sent Ukrainian Nazis to instruct Hong Kong protesters on how to organize a Chinese Maidan. Most of Ukrainian Nazi associations are sort of mobile private military companies serving the US State Department. Another probable goal behind sending Ukrainian Nazis is to bring discord between the Chinese government and Ukrainian oligarchs who started selling important military and scientific technologies to Chinese. Washington also brought the Vatican in to help with the organization of the Hong Kong maidan. Local Catholics began an open anti-government propaganda. Events in Hong Kong may provoke a chain reaction in other Chinese provinces and strengthen the activities of totalitarian sects. Furthermore, the Taiwanese leadership wants to seize power in the whole China with US secret assistance."
369,"The fight for the ‘liberal democracy’ seems to be on the rise in Moscow.

Russian investigators are looking for Sergei Fomin, one of the participants of the July 27 anti-government riot in Moscow, who left with an alleged stranger’s infant just to avoid a possible detention. The representative of the Moscow headquarters of the Investigative Committee, Yulia Ivanova, said that Sergei Fomin had dodged the investigators. She noted that, based on open information sources, Fomin, leaving the rally, picked up a stranger’s young child in his arms in order to freely pass the cordon."

373,"Detente in relations between Moscow and Brussels means a potential crisis for the current Polish authorities, pursuing an anti-Russian policy. Poland is going to commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. While they did not invite Russia, they sent an invitation to Germany.

Poland pursues a policy aimed at rapprochement with the US and even ignores EU players, and also exploits the theme of ""potential Russian aggression'. Today, Poland is the foundation of anti-Russian hysteria."

377,"It is an illusion that the Latvian government changed its policies and suddenly started caring about the people; put a stop to psychiatric Russophobia; stopping attempts to revise the results of WWII results and to rehabilitate fascism. Latvia’s decision to trade energy on the border with Russia, not through Lithuania as before, could not be adopted without the US's approval. Such geopolitical deals cannot be made by Latvia without Washington, just as the issues of moderate importance have to be agreed in Brussels.
The US's intention seems to increase leverage over Belarus by intensifying its economic dependence on Latvia. At some point in the future, if no concessions are made by the Belarusian authorities over some matters, Washington will be able to blackmail Minsk, saying that Latvia will interrupt imports of Belarusian energy."

379,"Latvia's decision to buy electricity at the Latvian-Russian border is an attempt to play a political game. Latvia wants to occupy a strategic position thanks to its location between Estonia and Lithuania. It also wants to place itself higher than the other Baltic states due to its Russophobic activities. Latvia wants to enhance bilateral relations with Belarus by becoming a large buyer of energy produced at the Belarusian nuclear power plant. Given that Latvian relations with Russia are tense, Latvia plans to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations this way. This is an artificial and silly measure though, which will hardly bring fruit for Latvia."
380,"A recently published a documentary proves that, among other things, the audio data presented by JIT as evidence was demonstrably manipulated and arbitrarily cut together. Other researchers also voiced doubts about the official version of the accident in 2018 with his research on MH17."
381,"The USSR was left alone in front of the Nazi aggression, as London and Paris refused to form a coalition. And, in fact, Poland was also an ally of Germany. 

Moscow had no other choice than signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Today this pact is being demonized, particularly by the countries who signed the Munich Agreement in 1938. "
382,"For many developing states or countries which are in colonial dependency (such as Ukraine) the termination of International Monetary Fund credit activities is literally a verdict, which is immediately followed by currency devaluation, and sometimes mass riots."

384,"Bosnia is pushed into NATO against the Serbs' will.

The Annual National Programme (ANP) is the first step towards the country's integration into NATO. Due to its flexible criteria, NATO can within a short period of time from receiving the ANP, submit a reply that would say: ""You have fulfilled the criteria and you can adopt the NATO membership in the Parliament."""
385,"The MH17 tragedy is being actively as a pretext of informational campaign against Russia. Russia was blamed from the very beginning - just few hours after the crash. Тhe investigation is inquisitional. Russia is always being blamed for everything, including this disaster. Russia was not allowed to take part in the investigation, despite the mentioning a number of factors that need to be clarified. But no one responded to the numerous calls of Russia."
386,"Naturally, Americans are trying to justify their decisions and claim that Russia is a violator of the INF Treaty, that it allegedly “developed the weapon” prohibited by the Treaty, i.e. Novator 9M729 missile. However, there have been no serious arguments provided by Washington to prove their position, and, most likely, the accusations of having “prohibited weapon” addressed to troublesome countries have become a sort of a business card of the American diplomacy."
387,"There was no French resistance to the invaders for more than a year. It’s not common knowledge whom the majority of the French actually supported.


Only one Nazi German has been killed by a French since the beginning of the Nazi occupation and it happened on 21 August 1941."
388,"The Soviet Union made every effort to create an anti-Hitler coalition with European countries in order to confront fascist Germany. However, in spite of all the USSR's efforts, Poland, France and Great Britain had signed the non-aggression pact with Germany, so the Soviet side had to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which was a forced measure."
389,"The F-18 pilot acted unacceptably […] There could be only one conclusion: the NATO pilot received an order to show ""who is the boss of the house"" over the Baltic sea. But it didn’t work out since our fighter jets warded him off. It was an intentional provocation."

392,"The Munich Agreement (1938) is the culmination of the helplessness of European diplomacy in front of the Nazi threat. This Munich conspiracy of European powers launched the largest war in history. 

UK and France did not want to form an anti-Nazi alliance with the USSR, which forced Moscow to take maintain peace on its territory with its own forces."

394,"The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany because it was forced to do so to ensure its security after the refusal of England and France to create an anti-German coalition together with the USSR.

As recognised by authoritative, including Western historians, until mid-August 1939, right up to the failure of tripartite negotiations, Joseph Stalin aimed to create an anti-Hitler coalition within the USSR, France and Great Britain.

399,"The world’s top banker and conspiracy master David Rockefeller, who most likely created the idea of anthropic global warming due to CO2, produced by the combustion of oil. Rockefeller was also the head of the Council on Foreign Relations that controls all medias. After Putin helped Assad to rid Syria of NATO’s terrorist groups in 2015, it was the end of the bankers’ dream of enlarging Israel. Out of the blue, continents of plastic emerged from the deep and whales suddenly started choking on straws when medias started demonizing plastic, another oil byproduct, to make the transition to electricity a priority more urgent than ever. The gullible masses are programmed to see a link between plastic and global warming, but they don’t seem to bother over the absurdity of it. Schools should start teaching the truth, instead of the science-deprived CO2 greenhouse effect and absurd anthropic global warming, or climate changes, or whatever you now want to call this theory."

406,"The version that Kyiv is working on, to disrupt the transit (of gas), is almost confirmed. Almost every day, Naftogaz representatives say they won’t sign the new contract. Of course, they blame Russia for everything, but they make it clear that, in any case, there will be no agreement. And they are developing an action plan that will be implemented only if the transit is suspended."

413,"The Resolution of the EU Parliament from September 18 [regarding the role of the USSR in the start of WWII] is a manifestation of anti-Russian activities. It is a part of the anti-Russian policy, which has been particularly present in Western Europe since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis. Possibly, if there was no crisis in Ukraine, this resolution wound not have existed. It is clear that this resolution on historical issues has a connection to the present day and to the current relations between Western Europe and Russia."
414,It is not surprising Angela Merkel accused Russia for the demise of the INF treaty. The US narrative about termination of the INF Treaty is now accepted by all its partners as an axiom. To say something else is to admit Washington's cardinal untruth.

This decision [of Fitch] to upgrade Russia’s rating confirms once again that the Russian economy has fully adapted to existing challenges and is able to achieve new growth rates."
416,"Numerous sources and experts confirm that the rallies of the so-called “opposition” in Moscow in recent weeks were coordinated and financed from abroad. The US embassy is openly advertising a rally in Moscow.

US State Department has prepared a manual on protest activities in Russia, which is distributed through the ECHR. The manual instructs the protesters to provoke the arrests, so that the number of detainees exceeds 1 million. The goal is to accuse the Russian authorities of tyranny and project this idea all over the world. The Western puppet masters expect that Russia's economy will weaken, if it has to make payments on the basis of the ECHR verdicts, especially to a million people.

We are talking about full-scale intervention, which aims to overthrow the legally elected Russian government."

420,"Soviet occupation is the favourite topic of Baltic politicians, inspired by the Americans.They have big problems in the Baltics.They have borrowed a lot of money from Europe, but now it is time to return it. Adults and young people left to work in other EU countries, only old people and children stayed. The only trump card for those countries is to keep this anti-Russian and anti-Soviet trend. Now, the Baltic states refuse to participate as millions of people of the planet celebrate the victory over fascism.

Against the backdrop of increasingly brave statements about the ""bright future"", in fact, Ukraine is more and more immersed in the pitch dark Middle Ages, in which even rockets mastered in production under the USSR are already becoming some kind of magical technology of forgotten ancestors."
425,"Police admitted that don’t have any evidence that the Russian President had played a role in this case. There was a lot of speculation about who was responsible, who gave the orders, all based on expert opinions from Russia. I need some evidence said Scotland Yard’s Deputy Chief Neil Basu."
426,"Western manoeuvres that always end up in sanctions or trade embargoes against Russia, China, Iran or other emerging countries are nothing but excuses for the defence of geopolitical interests.

In the conditions when the Ukrainian army obeys Turchinov’s order to kill the citizens of Donbas who protested peacefully, the main principle is the right to national liberation. The Ukrainian army is an army of looters, punishers, and killers."

An accident at the Mayak nuclear plant in southern Urals was said to have caused the nuclear cloud. Now, a team of physicists have established that Italian scientists from the Borexino neutrino detector, who performed physical experiments, were to blame for the leakage of radioactive ruthenium-106 into the atmosphere of Russia and Europe. The Russian Mayak plant, which was accused of releasing a hazardous chemical, is not to blame."

540,"Georgia fully depends not on its number one strategic partner – the United States, not on its “historical family” – Europe, but on “occupier” Russia. Only one threat from Moscow about banning Georgian imports has caused unprecedented depreciation of GEL (Georgian Lari) and resulted in record-high fuel prices. These developments are also causing damage to one of the few profitable branches of Georgia’s economy – tourism."

Open Secrets analyzed the most recent donor data for the top 10 political donors going into next year's first quarter. Unsurprisingly, 8 out of 10 of these fat cats are Jews."
565,"The European Union is a reactionary, oligarchic entity with a goal to create a unipolar world. In this context the EU views post-Soviet republics exclusively through the prism of unipolarity with the aim to keep the post-Soviet space in the state of disintegration. All EU programs, including the Eastern Partnership are designed around this idea. The sooner post-Soviet countries realize the harm of the European path, the sooner disintegration will end, and the countries will become truly independent."

Trump is already facing enormous pressure by the so-called ""opposition"" as a result of the manufactured Ukrainegate impeachment scandal, and with the Democrats about to enter the primary season early next year, it's entirely conceivable that their ""deep state"" allies might try to provoke the breakdown of the Donbas peace process in order to compel the President into offering even more military aid to Ukraine"

570,"The Malaysian Boeing's disaster is one of the pillars of the myth that Russia is the aggressor and must be subjected to sanctions.

Ukrainian authorities deny their involvement and blame Russia for everything. If the guilt of the Ukrainian side were proven in case of MH17, it would be much more difficult for Kyiv to convince irritated European partners to maintain anti-Russian sanctions."
571,"Russia supports a strong European Union led by Germany. Poland and the Baltic states are ""Trojan horses"" of American politics in the EU. They attempt to prevent a continental union between Russia and Germany, which Anglo-Saxons have always been very worried about.

A removal of Soviet monuments, an ideological challenge to both Belarus and Russia, is carried out by Polish authorities as instructed by the US. Poland is, therefore, a watchdog of the American imperialism. Its task is not only to spoil the relationship with Russia and to hold a hostile course towards 'Russkiy Mir' (Russian World) in the East but also to prevent Russia-German rapprochement."

586,"Poland did not invite Russia to the 80th anniversary of the beginning of World War II. On the other hand, Germany, the aggressor from 1939, was invited to the event. Polish Deputy Prime Minister explained the alleged aggression in the south-east of Ukraine as the reason for not inviting Russia.

As an indication of the manipulation, the Malaysian expert mentions the noise level in the sound recording: ""That is manipulated. The noise level differs from this audio track. See this soundtrack, the noise level differs in this part. It is lower here and higher here"".

Audio parts had been cut together. There are also many sections that have been cut out. ""That is clear, you can see that, the lack of parts of the audio recording,"" the analyst added."

599,"Firstly, we need Ukraine to be neutral. Ukraine, which will not join NATO. But it's necessary to raise another question. With the last elections, Ukraine completely cut off the Donbas. It is obvious that new Parliament will not comply with any Minsk agreements. It doesn't need it."

611,"These parliamentary elections were the last in Ukraine. There will be no elections in 2024. There will be no country called Ukraine. The events in the Middle East will make everyone forget what Ukraine is. We are talking about the WW3. Russia will be forced to let the refugees through to Ukraine, Europe and Turkey will do the same. The refugees will flood Ukraine, and it is going to be the end of the country."

614,"The 5 July UN Human Rights Report on the situation in Venezuela lays a disproportionate amount of blame on the Maduro government, but ignores the effect of the US sanctions on the deteriorating socioeconomic crisis plaguing the Latin American country.

While readily condemning government forces for violence and repression of dissent, it does not discuss deaths at the hands of opposition protesters between 2014 and 2017. In one infamous episode in June 2017, a 22-year-old man was burned alive by an angry opposition mob -- one of at least 60 people murdered by the guarimberos during that riot."

Obviously, no one wants to go for war with Russia. However, to present Russia as a reincarnation of the ""evil empire"" is always welcomed."
625,"The Polish leadership did not invite Russian President for events related to the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.

There are no stars in the photo and the US flag is waving, although there is no atmosphere on the Moon. Also there are no traces of the landing of the ship on the satellite. Even Buzz Aldrin himself recently admitted that he had never been on the Moon.

The money allocated for the fake “moon program” was in fact spent on financing the war in Vietnam and the development of the American military industrial complex.


Now Washington and NASA intend to fly to the Moon and even Mars in the same fake way.

638,"The EU is in a position to end the war in the Donbas with just one telephone call to Kyiv, to encourage the Ukrainian rulers to engage in dialogue.

The tactic that has been adopted by the EU on the Ukrainian issue is as follows: it is more convenient to impose sanctions against Russia than to end the war in Donbas with a call to Kyiv; encouraging Ukrainian leaders to engage in dialogue with the other side of the conflict.

The EU addresses Russia out of convenience, and not because Russia is the cause of the problem.

&nbsp;"
639,"Russia is not a part of the domestic conflict in Ukraine.

The Chinese police identified one such person; their photo was published by the Hong Kong press. His name is Brian Patrick Kane. He's an American. He shouted, ""Do not step back"", he tried to teach young Chinese people to humiliate and attack the police."
641,"The downing of MH17 flight was not an accident, it was a carefully considered and prepared multi-faceted domestic operation. Russia was deemed guilty by default."
642,The law on the Ukrainian language regulates a language that is simply a dialect of Russian.
643,"The West had been preparing participants of Euromaidan since May 2013. Throughout 2013, Western countries were preparing the population for a turn towards the West. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has been training activists since spring 2013 on how to use social networks to organise protests. The British Embassy launched a communications strategy in early 2013 aimed at encouraging Ukrainians to join the EU and to sign the Association Agreement."
644,"The mystery of the crash of the Boeing 777 of Malaysia Airlines remains unsolved.

The international investigation led by the Netherlands continues and Russia denounces it as biased, accusing investigators of neglecting the evidence it provides. In autumn 2016, the Russian aeronautical authority, Rosaviatsia, provided radar data showing that no missiles had been launched from the rebel-held areas on the day of the crash. The Dutch said that the Russian radar was unable to locate a relatively small object the size of a missile. In response, Oleg Stortchevoy, head of Rosaviatsia, rejected this claim, adding that the radar station could detect objects much smaller than a BUK missile. In September 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defence held a press conference presenting documents demonstrating that the missile at the origin of the tragedy belonged to Ukraine and was produced in 1986. Russia claimed to have been able to reconstruct the history of the missile with serial number 8868720. It was produced in a factory in the Moscow region in 1986, before being delivered to a Ukrainian military unit, according to documents submitted by the Russian Defence.

Ukraine, which had decided not to close its airspace in a conflict region, escapes international condemnation."
645,"The Russian army has never sent any ground troops, and hence no special units to Syria. The article by Reuters about alleged involvement of Russian ground forces and special units in the province of Idlib is an absolute lie. Only observation troops of the Russian military police are positioned in Idlib.
"
646,"For years, Washington has avoided a dialogue to solve the problems within the framework of the INF Treaty. The US claim that Russia violated the agreement is totally unfounded, and the US withdrawal from the INF, under the excuse that [Russia] refused to destroy the 9M-729 missile, is totally unacceptable."
647,"US Central Command is increasing the presence of mercenaries in Syria to make up for the withdrawal of regular troops. Only in the second half of June another 540 private military contractors arrived to the country, including commanders and instructors. The mercenaries are transported by car in groups of 12 to 16 people, and their task is mainly to form combat units loyal to Washington and protect oil and gas infrastructures."
648,NATO forces are preparing colour revolutions in some Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) countries to put Western-controlled regimes in power. The goal of the Atlantic Alliance is to seed discord among the members of the CSTO and cooperating with NATO always implies an anti-Russian element.
649,"Instead of accusing Russia of “all sorts of sins,” Europe should begin a constructive dialogue on the INF Treaty. Europe must look at itself, review its behavior and start a constructive dialogue in order to preserve this treaty. But they are doing everything to destroy the INF Treaty, and then blame Russia."
650,"Russia has its own version of what happened [with the MH17 flight downing on July 17, 2014]. But Western investigators simply assigned the perpetrators. If there was evidence, they would turn it into a bigger show. But they have nothing, so they continue to raise this topic by official statements. This is easier than admitting that the investigation was not objective."
651,"


After the collapse of the USSR, the West believed that the “end of history” had arrived. And that it was then allowed to grossly interfere in the affairs of certain states. Moreover, it unceremoniously commands internal political processes. Ukraine is the most glaring example.





"
652,We must remember that the European Council is imposing irrational and unjustified sanctions on us [Russia]. 
653,"It is often said that Stalin or the Soviet government entered into a treaty with Germany in order to divide Poland and seize the Baltic states. Thе treaty was signed on the basis of national interests. But USSR had neither documents nor facts showing that Hitler would definitely attack Poland. There were intelligence reports - this was assumed, but there was no certainty. USSR certainly was not going to divide Poland."
654,"If we have a closer look at the laboratory expert group, it consist of the following members; Terence Wan (Chair) Hong Kong, Arieh Cohen from Denmark, Bruno Garrido from Brazil, Catrin Goebel from Australia, Andrea Gotzmann from Germany, Tiia Kuuranne from Finland, Bruno le Bizec from France, Jenny Schulze from Sweden, Lorraine Turner from the UK and Peter van Eenoo from Belgium. The geopolitics are not favorable for Russia. The team manically consists of members of the pro-Western bloc, so it's no wonder that this team voted all in favor of putting a four-year ban on Russia."

658,"Тhe collapse of the USSR was a blow to Russia. The USSR represented Russia, even though there were many countries in it. And for the modern Polish elites, what is bad for Russia, is, in general, good."
659,"A television link-up was planned between viewers in Minsk (sic) and Moscow, which caused an absolute phenomenal wave of panic in Ukraine, since it is unthinkable to allow Ukrainians to talk with Russians, simple people, to find out that they have a lot of things in common. They have the same roots and talk about the same things.

Except that in Russia it is much better than in Ukraine. In Russia, there is no Hitler, and in Ukraine there are Neo-Nazis."
660,"Soros' associates, including Victor Pinchuk, are behind Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pinchuk and his people placed a bet on the political parties of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Svyatoslav Vakarchuk. Therefore, the US Democratic Party will inevitably win in the Ukrainian elections, because these parties are likely to form a governing coalition."
661,"Western countries deliberately hide the details of the chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma on 7 April 2018, because the attack did not happen; this is another fake from the Western leadership. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons hides these facts, in order not to be the violator of international law."
662,"Russophobia has become a normal thing in Ukraine, even outside of politics. Cultural and educational exchanges, as well as contacts between relatives, have almost been forbidden."
663,"While holding the EU presidency, Finland initiates a discussion in the EU about Russia-sanctions feasibility."
664,"We are talking about the president of a country with an ongoing civil war, where an army takes part in an internal conflict, where people are killed, and where peaceful citizens continue to die."
665,"Verkhovna Rada proposed to introduce criminal punishment for not recognising Crimea as part of Ukraine. The emergence of such an initiative may appear because in Ukraine a huge number of people consider Crimea as part of the Russian Federation.

Ukrainians acknowledge this fact and treat it with understanding. In this regard, the Ukrainian authorities, despite five years of brainwashing their people, despite the anti-Russian rhetoric, could not overcome absolute reality."
666,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden treat NATO as an instrument worn on the finger of the United States. Only Biden really wants to return to the situation of Obama, making NATO a totalitarian pig that completely follows the United States and does what the United States wants."
667,There is no border between Russia and Ukraine after the latter pulled out of the treaty with Russia.
668,Ukrainian sailors had admitted their intention to provoke Russia with the maneuver in the Black Sea. Even the logbook documents state that these ships had secretly entered Russian waters and wanted to pass undercover through the Kerch Strait. It is a deliberate provocation. This is clear from the documents and from the sailors' statements.
669,"NATO was formed to confront the Soviet Union. There is now neither the Soviet Union nor the Warsaw Treaty, that is, the military alliance established in response to the creation of NATO. However, NATO is still present and even expanding. At the moment of its formation, the Alliance included 12 countries, but the number of members now is 29, while the total military spending of the alliance exceeds 70% of global military spending. Today we must start from the fact that NATO expansion and infrastructure development near the Russian border represent one of the potential threats to our country's security.

&nbsp;"
670,"In November 2018, Russia confiscated three Ukrainian ships, including the crew, 22 marines and two members of the Ukrainian secret service. These ships had entered Russian waters in the Kerch Strait without registration. After ignoring several warnings from the Russian coastguard, the Ukrainian ships were finally seized by Russian border guards and the FSB."
671,"The new head of the General Staff of Armed Forces of Ukraine confirmed that the incident in the Kerch Strait was a provocation, staged by Poroshenko in the run-up to the election campaign. That is an impertinence. The Ukrainian side admitted to the provocation."
672,"The United Kingdom is isolating the “inconvenient ones”: it is ok to lie when all the like-minded ones stand up and lie in chorus, without those who will tell the truth. It is easier not to let Russia Today and Sputnik in, so they don’t ask the wrong questions. The fashion for Russophobia is still very much alive. They are in a state of panic that someone will ask the wrong questions."
673,"The incident in the Kerch Strait was a planned provocation by (Petro) Poroshenko.

The former president Poroshenko brought about this provocation purposefully in the course of the election campaign. He knew that the voters in the east and south of the country would not support him, and used this provocation to aggravate the situation, to introduce the state of emergency. He either wanted to introduce the state of emergency throughout the country or perhaps to postpone the elections. They wanted to keep power at all costs."
674,"


Anti-Russian hysteria in Georgia was a well-prepared provocation. It proves that there are forces that want to break cultural and economic ties with Russia. The same as with Ukraine and Moldova. Because even though the USSR disappeared, the connections remain. The West has always dreamed of splitting Russia into many small states in order to control them.


"
675,It would be better for Georgia to wake up and understand that [current protests in Georgia] are not a “home grown” protest but one carefully manipulated from the US.
676,"NATO's adoption of the biggest budget in its history clearly demonstrates the alliance's quest for hegemony in the whole world, including the Middle East."
677,"Poles are not really independent. Polish economy survives thanks to German contracts and its military budget is subject to NATO requirements. Polish energy sphere is becoming more dependent on expensive American liquefied gas.

680,"G7 is not an international organisation. It has no charter or any kind of fundamental principles. It is not even a elite club. G7 is a mouthpiece of the Trilateral Commission. G7 convenes annually, some times after the Trilateral Commission's annual convention.The Trilateral Commission is an attempt to unite Anglo-Saxons, Europeans and the Japanese. The decisions, taken in the Trilateral Commission behind the veils, are made public by the G7. This demonstrates the Western leaders' role as marionettes; they are merely dancing according to the music of the conceptual centres in the shadows.

681,"Despite the outwardly “reassuring” mood of European diplomats, the Eastern Partnership program, according to many experts, was from the very beginning aimed at weakening Russia's geopolitical influence in Eastern Europe as well as at creating alternative energy supply routes for Europe."

683,"The ""collective West"" has instigated a hybrid war against Russia, containing three major elements: the first element is the economic warfare; the second - sustaining local and regional conflicts. The third, and most important element is information-psychological war - activities aimed at influencing the psychology of the adversary.

The United States are carefully and methodologically preparing a social outburst, a ""colour revolution"" and a coup d'etat in Russia in 2021--2022, around the time of the next parliamentary elections in Russia.

685,"The LGBT flag waved by the British embassy in Belarus brings destructive consequences to Belarusian society. The US, Swedish and Israel embassies as well as the UN and WHO offices in Belarus also issued statements in support of the LGBT community. Belarusian opposition forces, civic campaigners, human rights defenders and independent media support 'holers' [the term used to describe LGBT by former Belarusian Interior Minister Ihar Shunevich] consider May 17th a more important day than Victory Day (May 9th). The promotion of same-sex marriages by foreign actors is aimed to divide Belarusian society, which values family over foreign perversions. Nevertheless, the Belarusian opposition along with the British Embassy continues to impose their values on the whole society."
686,"The Belarusian National Congress (BNC), chaired by opposition politician Mikalai Statkevich, is a real aggressor. It is aggressive towards the Belarusian government, president, the Kremlin, and Belarusian people. Under the cover of peaceful protests, they continue calling people to protest and to burn rubber on Maidan. Such calls will intensify on the eve of Belarusian parliamentary and presidential campaigns. They would not boycott elections as in 2015, because this time the West tasked the BNC with violent take-over of power in Belarus."
687,"The population of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk republics has turned away from Ukraine, the people don’t see themselves as part of it any more."
688,"The Belarusian opposition supports pro-Western propaganda and blames Lukashenko and Putin for everything. It misrepresents the situation alleging that American missiles in Poland are directed against Lukashenko and Putin personally. Hence, it calls people to take part in protests and to overthrow the dictatorship, otherwise the missiles will strike ordinary people. This is slave's rhetoric because the missiles are targeting all, including opposition members.

Instead of protesting against it, the opposition asks for more American missiles against own people. The opposition treats the Belarusian people as cannon fodder and disrespects it to the extent that this can provoke a global war. Even in case of real military actions, the opposition will be vehemently arguing that the West is good while Russia is bad. Belarusian independent media will support any American military provocation launched from the Polish territory."
689,"Following the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kyiv, a civil war broke out in east Ukraine and the residents of Crimea held a referendum to rejoin Russia."
690,Ukraine will not secure itself by becoming a member of NATO.
691,"As soon as the Russian delegation was re-admitted to PACE, anti-Russian resolutions went one after another. Then, all these ECHR decisions against Russia! And Russia has to pay many thousands of Euros to the victims. The Council of Europe is completely meaningless and absolutely an anti-Russian organisation. Participation in PACE is not effective."
692,"NATO is preparing colour revolutions in a number of post-Soviet countries, which will result in coups d'état and installation of Western-friendly regimes in those states."
693,The US and several of their allies supported the coup d’état in Ukraine in February 2014.
694,George Soros destabilises states in order to provoke civil wars like Euromaidan in Ukraine
695,Russia’s 9M729 missile does not violate the INF Treaty. This missile was not developed nor tested with a range superior to that established by the INF Treaty. The US has never produced any proof that the missile violated the INF Treaty.
696,"Russia's triumphal victory in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics made Americans and their allies worry about the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. They were tempted to use Crimea and Donbas events as a pretext to attack Russia through boycotting the Olympics but eventually decided to act through WADA, accusating Russia of purposeful doping policies. After 2014 a real anti-Russian ""cold war"" in sport has been waged. This war will be on at least until 2032 whatever the Russian anti-doping agency would do.

WADA's attack has very little to do with combating doping. Instead, it aims at removing Russia as a strong sports competitor, pressing Vladimir Putin and the Russian government by demonstrating their alleged corruption and international isolation to the Russian population, and at humiliating Russia. There's nothing more humiliating than athletes competing without national flag and anthem. Maybe they should also wear a prison uniform or a uniform with yellow stars as poor Jews in Nazi ghetto?

Members of WADA Executive Committee include representatives of the UK, Norway, Slovakia, Belgium, Turkey, Czechia, Italy, Poland, Australia, Sudan, and Ecuador. The representatives of the two latter countries are assigned a rather decorative role, whereas all the others are US allies. The Committee does not include members who have any independence from the US, thus allowing them to solve the problem. Russia should adopt an asymmetric response: to check if Russian law enforcement agencies have anything on the members of the WADA Executive Committee and to think of organizing alternative Olympic Games and World Championships."
697,"While there has been a long-standing narrative promoted for over 70 years that the British Empire disappeared after World War II having been replaced by the “American Empire”, it is the furthest thing from the truth. Henry Kissinger’s takeover of the State Department ushered in a new era of British occupation of American foreign policy, whereby the republic increasingly became the “Dumb Giant” acting as “American Brawn for the British brains” using Churchill’s words.

The policy of Anglo-Saxon imperialism had been promoted subversively by British-run think tanks known as the Round Table Movement and Fabian Society, and the seeds had already been laid for the anti-Russian cold war by those British-run American fascists.

While a nihilistic generation of youth were tuning in on LSD, and an old guard of patriots surrounding Wallace and Kennedy had fallen to the “red scare” witch hunt, geopolitical theory was fed like a sweet poison down the throat of a sleeping nation, replacing a policy of peace and “win-win cooperation” with an imperial clone masquerading as a republic."

703,"There’s no use arguing that a person with Ursula von der Leyen's track record cannot possibly succeed in the highest post in the EU, therefore it’s evident that some force has been strongly “promoting” her to this post. It is not difficult to identify this “mysterious force”, since nor Europe, nor its ordinary citizens can gain anything from poor leadership. It’s noteworthy that in the aftermath of yet another catastrophe associated with poor leadership – Brexit, Washington has lost its last means of directly influencing European politics through London.

707,"The protests in Tbilisi have an external component. A confrontation between countries to receive control over Georgia’s Anaklia deep-sea port has a geopolitical dimension. Even the most cautious steps taken by Tbilisi to build a dialogue with Moscow cause nervousness in Washington.

It is evident that Anaklia will be developing not only as a logistical facility, but also as a naval base. This will accelerate Georgia’s integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. As a result, the US and NATO ships will be stationed close to the Russian borders, including Crimea and Abkhazia. Washington in playing out its Georgian strategy."

709,"NATO does not deserve the Czech Republic's 2% [of the GDP]. Czech defence spending should not serve the expansionary pan-world efforts of the United States, as has unfortunately been the case so far. It would be extremely sad if Czech taxpayers' money should be used to further liquidate sovereign nation states, to promote the interests of multinational corporations, and last but not least, to initiate wars over natural resources."
710,"Russia has never interfered in the internal affairs of any country. Neither the EU countries, nor any other country in the world and do not want to interfere. This is our most important difference to the USA and its allies, who, for example, supported the overthrow in Ukraine in February 2014."
711,"Ukraine continues to violate the rights of the Russian-speaking population: nationalist ideas continue to dominate the country's state policy, and the new President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cannot solve the problem with aggressive radicals and repeal the nationalist law, which forces Ukrainian citizens to speak only Ukrainian."
712,"The foundation of the well-known philanthropist George Soros Open Society is to blame for the anti-Russian protests in Georgia. On 20 June, the organisation openly called on Georgians to protest. After that, provocations against Russia began in Tbilisi."
713,"The United States is making preparations for Ukraine to launch a new provocation against Russia in the Black and Azov Seas. The international military exercises ""Sea Breeze 2019"" need Ukraine in order to work out a plan to seize the Russian Crimea. Washington and Kyiv also intend to exacerbate the situation and present Russia in an unfavourable light."
714,"Nazi Germany did not emerge on its own. There was an external support behind its creation, with the aim to confront the USSR and Soviet society. Nazi Germany was a collective West attacking the USSR. Oddly enough, at present Poland is siding with those who attempted to conquer the USSR. For instance, Poland raises the issue of the monuments of Soviet soldiers. It is a Western tradition to destroy the whole history, because, according to Joseph Goebbels, people without history become a tool at the hands of Western propaganda."
715,"The American Government is not responsive to what the public wants; it is responsive only to what the politically involved super-rich — the people who mainly fund politics — want. And those billionaires also control, or even own, all of the major ’news’ media, and so their propaganda filters-out such realities as that the country is a dictatorship, no democracy at all."
716,"In recent years, the United States has become particularly active in expanding the activities of its religious sects to other states, thus undermining the religious foundation of other societies. Moreover, those sects have played a major role in the intensification of protest activities in a number of coup d’etat attempts across the globe over the years. One can find a number of curious revelations about the role that religious sects played in assisting the CIA across the EU and the US.

Soros' office in Armenia has influence over the country's authorities and has been an active participant of the velvet revolution.

722,"Russia, unlike Washington and its allies, has not interfered and is not going to interfere in the internal affairs of either the EU or other countries of the world.

The accusations of the US and the EU against Russia are absurd and unsubstantiated. Despite suspicions about the ""Russian interference"" in the US presidential election, the Americans could not find concrete evidence. The sanctions against Moscow imposed because of these accusations still remain in force.

The main purpose of these accusations is to “demonise” Russia in the eyes of Europeans."
723,The United States intentionally keeps Poland on a short anti-Russian “leash” as the Poland-Russia conflict makes this country lonely on the international arena. The relations between Poland and Russia will continue to be tense as it is beneficial for the United States to keep Poland in conflict with Russia.
724,"The current administration of the United States has adventurous foreign policy – there is an increasing number of hot spots in the world: Venezuela, [North] Korea, Syria; now we have an unstable situation around Iran and establishment of US military facilities in Eastern Europe, close to Russian borders.

739,The New York Times sends its pieces to US government for approval.
740,Ukraine may be implicated in MH17 downing. The Joint Investigative Team (JIT) ignores Russian radar data and proof that the missile that fired the Malaysian Boeing 777 belonged to Ukraine.

742,"Russia and China inflicted a destructive blow to the dollar by signing an intergovernmental agreement on payment exchanges in national currencies.

746,"The Russophobic protests in Georgia, which erupted in the wake of a Russian lawmaker's visit to Tbilisi, are a result of geopolitical engineering performed by Western politicians.

By orchestrating the riots, the West is trying to rip apart the ties and common history between Russians and Georgians."
747,"In the winter of 2013-2014, the Maidan Revolution in Kyiv ousted former President Viktor Yanukovich who had refused to ratify an association agreement with the European Union, getting closer to  Vladimir Putin's Russia. A diplomatic disaster for Europe: Washington and Brussels proposing such an agreement actually forced Ukraine to choose a side, pushing the country to a civil war, while it had been a buffer between the West and Russia until then.

The conflict turned into a disaster for the Ukrainian army. But how was this possible? How could a region of 3 million people and its army of 10-15,000 insurgents stand up to a country of 40 million and its 150,000 soldiers? Do not forget that the people of Donbas defend their home, their land, their history, their heritage.

One must understand one thing Russia absolutely did not want this war in Donbas. One thing is certain, it was not the Russians who provoked this war."
748,The Baltic economy is subsidized. The countries live mainly at the expense of the EU budget.
749,"'Old' EU member states have quite developed economic ties with Russia. They followed the 'new' EU member states and supported the introduction of sanctions on Russia only after the famous provocation of 17 July 2014 when Flight MH17 was shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners. At present, the 'old' EU member states delay the investigation into the downing of MH17 because it has become clear that Russian responsibility cannot be established."
750,"On 18 March 2014, the referendum in Crimea sealed the peninsula's connection to Russia, after the latter sent its troops. In fact, Moscow could not conceive that this peninsula, strategic and historically Russian, was going to become Western, or that NATO would set up troops there."

755,"Russia repeatedly proposed the inclusion of Russian specialists in the MH17 investigation, submitted various data and materials, including the results of the investigation conducted by “Almaz-Antey”. However, all Russian initiatives were ignored, while Ukraine was treated with indulgence. The whole investigation into the case of the Malaysian Boeing is politically motivated. The investigation has the sole purpose of tarnishing Russia. "

Great Britain is the main locomotive of the Russophobic trend in the world. Great Britain cannot recognize Russia, because Russia has challenged the British empire and won."
763,"The European Union, having seen enough of this ugly nonsense, has decided that Ukraine, which has become a stumbling-block in EU-Russia relations, does not deserve that much attention. The question of Crimea has been put in brackets.

We cannot claim that sanctions will be lifted, most likely not, however they will no longer have this sick attitude to the question of Crimea or sailors that Ukraine considers prisoners of war."

767,"The closer the launch of the Astravets NPP in Belarus, the more often alleged safety issues of the NPP are reported. In reality, not a single Lithuanian argument against the Astravets NPP has found its confirmation. Lithuania has been running a deliberate information and political campaign against the Belarusian NPP because it is a flagship project for Belarus and Russia. Lithuania is unhappy about Belarus-Russia cooperation in the nuclear field. Hence, the Lithuanian political elite's attempts to block a common Belarus-Russia project that has become a symbol of the Union State between Belarus and Russia."
768,"Colour revolution techniques increasingly manifest in the continued protests in Tbilisi. It is a strange coincidence that Mike Carpenter, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, tweeted about the possible negative consequences of the open door policy of the current Georgian government in relations with Russia just a couple days before the scandal in the Georgian parliament took place. Carpenter is one of the Kyiv Maidan curators who was later in charge of Ukraine's external governance.

Washington curators of the 'sanitary zone' along Russian borders are unhappy about the normalisation of Georgian-Russian relations. They need the heaviest possible anti-Russian policies from post-Soviet countries. Any sovereign decision of Georgia disliked by the US, be it non-alignment with Western sanctions over Russia or abolition of visas for Russian tourists, risk provoking a colour revolution. Professional regime changers work on making the Belarusian government pro-Western in order to achieve a revolution in Belarus too.

Last year, Carpenter visited Belarus allegedly in the framework of restoring relations with the West. Over 20 years, the West has created all infrastructure necessary for a regime change in Belarus. Dozens of media outlets, NGOs, political parties, etc. function on American and European money. All of them can mobilise their audiences and employees to take part in mass riots at any moment."

Sending two Moldovan military contingents, on June 28 2019, to participate in exercises in the US and Ukraine is aimed at preparing soldiers and officers for a possible attack on Transnistria, which means preparing for an anti-Russian confrontation.

773,"Belarusian opposition leader Andrei Sannikau works for the CIA and RAND to destabilise Belarus with a ""European Belarus"" civic campaign. During his recent visit to the RAND Corporation, Sannikau spoke about the need to stage a coup in Belarus with US military assistance. The US actors ordered Sannikau to ignite a war in Belarus similar to the war in Donbas. The US sees Belarus as a springboard for military actions against Russia and is ready to pay well for it.

Andrei Sannikau made a promise to the US to organise this springboard on the condition that the US military would support a coup in Belarus. Sannikau is getting ready for the 2020 presidential campaign under the secret name ""It is time to change peaceful times""."
774,"Lithuania considers its railway a tool of Russian and Belarusian soft power and a Soviet legacy. It voices the need to rebuild the railway network according to European standards. This will require around 900-950 annual Lithuanian' budgets, meaning that Lithuania will be ready to undertake this task by the end of this millennium."
775,Western bodies - perhaps except the US Congress - are all tired of this all-encompassing Russophobia. The West's vision of world politics has been built on Russophobia at least for the last five years.
776,"The Belarusian opposition views past historical events in a light favourable to both the West and fascism. The ancestors of opposition activists were fascist collaborators during WWII and exterminated civilians. Hence, they have a fierce hatred at the genetic level.

The Belarusian opposition would be much happier if at the anniversary of Nazi Germany's attack on the USSR (June 22nd) people would take to the streets wearing swastikas and shouting ""Long live Belarus!"" and ""Glory to Ukraine!"". The opposition would also prefer seeing garrison soldiers wearing LGBT badges. Only in this case would the opposition acknowledge the significance of commemorating WWII history."
777,"[...] The Ukrainian authorities do not wish to talk with or to listen to anyone. They deny all peaceful means of Donbas conflict solution without being able to solve the issue by military means.

778,"The Belarusian opposition does its best to sabotage the 2nd European Games, and is already organizing provocations. Its representatives are implicated in the illegal sale of tickets and have even turned to the Russian activist group Pussy Riot who came to support them. The Belarusian opposition will bring a bunch of people, armed to the teeth, in order to humiliate Belarus in the eyes of foreigners.

Another strategy to spoil the 2nd European Games is to deflect public attention towards the EuroGames 2019 for gays and lesbians in Madrid. This event is one of the most important for the Belarusian opposition, just as May 17th when the UK embassy flies LGBT flags. The Belarusian opposition began selling tickets for the EuroGames and promises to issue citizens with visas for it free of charge, with the aim of taking Belarusians away from the country's main event."
779,"The recent resignation of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Ihar Shunevich, became a real celebration for the Belarusian opposition. Shunevich was an opponent of gays, lesbians, and transvestites, and an advocate of family values. He irritated Belarusian patriots and became a personal opponent for Belarusian human rights defender [Valiancin Stefanovich] who was advocating for gay traditions of those countries where such traditions have turned into madness.

He also negatively reacted to waiving LGBT flag by UK embassy on 17 May and must have found himself blacklisted by the UK ambassador to Belarus Fiona Gibb.

Despite Shunevich's resignation, Belarusian opposition may continue the hunt against him and attempts to prosecute Shunevich. The UK embassy, and personally Fiona Gibb, may finance a harassment campaign by the Belarusian opposition. Hence Shunevich must be given immunity from prosecution as this will guarantee the integrity of our family values.

780,The Ukrainian political nation in its present composition has absolutely failed and is ineffective. The question is only whether the intelligent part of Europe now really understands this and will make appropriate conclusions.
781,"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is simply mocking. See the frequency of some used words. It is special rhetoric when the words ""occupied territories"" are said so many times. The one who says this does it on purpose. This bastard is the same as Poroshenko or maybe even worse."
782,"One of the taboo topics in Europe is the United States' occupation of Germany. Ask any local Bavarian and they will tell you that there is no peace treaty with the United States, that the US is indeed the occupant, that the people are helpless, and that Bavaria should quit Germany, but not the European Union."
783,"The Baltic States are demonizing Russia, blaming it for occupation, demanding reparations, and brainwashing young generations that there is an enemy in their neighborhood. They are trying to erase from memory every mention of Russia and the Soviet Union. They are bothered by monuments for the soldier-liberators who saved the Baltics from fascism.

Today they also want to erase the great sports achievements and all memory of the USSR around the world.

The main topic of debates in the Lithuanian parliament is a sports jersey. They are calling upon all of the world to prohibit Soviet symbols. Russophobia is the main export of Lithuania."
784,"Ukraine is best at selling anti-Russian, Russophobic sentiments and mobilising anti-Russian feelings. By exercising this role, it is forgiven many sins [by the West] in its internal policy, economics and corruption. The only reason for this is that it must work against Russia."
785,"Ukrainian and Georgian political elites are interconnected in many ways, […]  not to mention such examples as the Georgian snipers at Euromaidan."
786,"Whilst understanding the sensitivities of the Georgians, the current occasion, which was based on a ""protocol error"" from the host (Georgian) side, as they later admitted, seems rather null and void for such riots.

We think this action was planned, because dozens of cameras were set up at lightning speed. People who came to the meeting demonstrated with pre-prepared posters with dirty, offensive, anti-Russian content. It was obvious that it was not the orthodox forum, to which Georgia itself applied for participation, that was the cause of the riots, but an attempted coup d'état and occupation of Parliament."

790,"The dismantling of USSR Marshal Zhukov bust in Kharkiv is a test for president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Those behind the toppling of the monument want to find out how Zelenskyy will react to this provocation. If Zelensky does not react, it will mean the continuation of post-Maidan Ukraine's policies in cultural, ideological and other fields which are being managed by radical nationalists. They serve as transmission belts for NATO provocations and its aggressive and isolating policies towards Russia."
791,"Greta Thunberg has declared war on white men.

The ""green madness"" that has captured the Western world has already had serious economic consequences. If the two symbolic figures of the global ""green movement"", Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, get their way, the world will never be the same again, and Russia and China are likely to remain the last islands of common sense in a world that wants to forget common sense."
792,"A larger presence of US and NATO military forces in Poland aims at ""Drang nach Osten"" (""Drive to the East"") against Russia. Belarus is likely to become a transit area for aggression against Russia. A pretext for escalation in the region can be anything, a made-up 'Russian aggression in Ukraine"" or a blatant provocation with the use of the American unmanned aerial vehicle MQ-9 Reaper as in the Gulf of Oman. However, the West's collective hunt against Russia and its allies is doomed to fail because Russia will do everything to defend allied countries and itself."
793,The EU lacks sovereignty and independence [from the US] both in the military and political fields.
794,"Ukraine's whole diplomatic strategy since 2014 has been built around the mythology of war with Russia. The Ukrainian idea is to increase external pressure on Russia to bring it to the negotiating table and to abandon talks about bringing special status to Ukraine's eastern regions.

The real goal behind Zelenskyy's recent visits to Germany and France was not to present a new plan of peaceful resolution of the Donbas conflict, because such a plan does not exist. The visits were intended to find out if Western partners are still ready to assist Ukraine in the international legalisation of the Donbas conflict as 'Russian aggression.'"
795,"Ukrainian military began to leave positions at the demarcation line with the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, due to poor provision and living conditions. The Ukrainian generals are trying to reason with the officers, but they still don't want to fight in Donbas.

796,"Mainstream Polish media have not published a single interview with Mateusz Piskorski, accused of spying for Russia in 2016. Moreover, they are not interested in his fate, his life in prison or his life after his release on bail."
797,"Poland is not a comfortable country for entrepreneurs, as the Polish government has decided to increase the quantum of social security contributions levied on private businesses. This enormous increase in taxation will challenge the functioning of a significant number of local businesses, which will have to face the rising costs of labor.

798,"NATO Parliamentary Assembly is a pro American organization created for confrontation with Russia. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly will, by all possible means, not only show a negative attitude towards Russia, but also escalate the confrontation to justify its existence."
799,"It was not an 'annexation' of Crimea.

It is apparently a duty for every politician to include the phrase 'annexation of the Crimea contrary to international law' in his speech."
800,"Russia does not violate the INF Treaty and does not create dangerous weapons capable of carrying nuclear charges. The United States is the one violating international agreements on arms control while accusing Russia of everything in order to freely deploy missiles in Europe.

The EU has long been thinking about the expediency of the existence of NATO and no longer has confidence in the North Atlantic Alliance."
803,"Protests in Georgia are nothing but Russophobic provocation. They are premeditate, aimed at  complicating Georgia’s relations with Russia, which is interested in developing economic, cultural and tourist ties. 

 It is an attempt of a coup d'etat by radical extremist forces, which are coordinated from abroad and may be associated with ex-President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili."
804,"On May 20, on behalf of the North Atlantic Alliance, territorial claims were presented to Russia  by the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach. NATO has demanded that Russia ""come out of Crimea"". And, moreover, that it ""return back NATO bases"" in Crimea.

805,"The task of manipulating the media has always been a top priority for the CIA. A program for Internship for journalists from Central Asia has been launched. Those hand-picked by Uncle Sam will now receive training in the United States next month. The US State Department has already sent appropriate invitations to various media personalities from across the Central Asia, while all of the US embassies across the region are tasked with making sure that everything would go smooth. Unsurprisingly, the funding of this “internship” program is going to be provided by the US Central Command.

Uncle Sam will try to learn just how loyal those media personalities will be to the United States before instructing them further. That is the true price that the world is paying for the American-style democracy, that is the death of truthful journalism.

806,"We cannot stop the cycle of unrelenting imperialism until we speak with certainty why the wheels are spinning in the first place. 9/11 was a Jewish-Zionist job. 17 years on, it’s beyond overdue that everyone says it. 9/11 is Jewry’s crime."
807,"Bearing in mind that Americans are performing inspections at the Ukrainian front-line more and more often, a set-up is very much likely, where someone from a Nato delegation is killed. That would be organised as a ""involvement of a third party"" or just a shooting, where the blame will be put on the home-guard of Donbas. After all, would Pentagon really hesitate to kill a colonel or diplomat or two in order to instigate a war?

The well-oiled machinery of Western propaganda would spring into action immediately and blame the home-guard of Donbas or directly on Russia. Then the cannons will start talking. It's a hard-working system, applied many times; for instance in former Yugoslavia. The concept of setting up the death of NATO representatives is, according to rumours from the Ukrainian ministry of defence, already discussed."

810,US cyber attacks are the reason behind wide-scale power cuts in three South American countries as training for hitting Russia's energy infrastructure.
811,"Hong Kong’s opposition has already long been exposed as US-sponsored. The protests in Hong Kong are organized to delay the inevitable end to the West’s “primacy” over Asia and in particular its attempts to dominate China.  In the process, these protests will continue to expose Washington’s methods of fueling political subversion and the Western media’s role in deceitfully promoting and defending it – compromising similar operations being carried out elsewhere across Asia-Pacific and around the world. US Colour Revolution Masquerades as “Popular Opposition”.
"
812,"The West accuses Russia of direct participation in the armed conflict in the Donbas, although the Russian Armed Forces had never participated in military operations in the neighbouring country. Even experts from the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE), who have been in Donbas for years, were not able to prove that."
813,"Presenting evidence 5 years after the MH17 crash indirectly indicates the fabricated nature of the evidence.

The evidence gathered by the JIT does not stand up to criticism, and is unacceptable as the basis for such loud accusations.

Accusations based on telephone calls and dialogue in social networks is extremely doubtful."
814,"Russian authorities are concerned about the US biological-military activity near Russia’s borders. There are over 200 secret research laboratories in the world mostly funded by the US Department of Defence, focusing on doubtful investigations, the Richard Lugar Centre in Georgia is one of the most notorious. Russia has more than on one occasion drawn attention to Pentagon's activities, which deploys its laboratories in the vicinity of Russian borders.

815,"Baltic countries dream about becoming an American base. Firstly, because the Americans will pay them something. Then, their hysteria about terrible Russia, which will destroy them, will weaken a little bit. And lastly, they are hoping the US will help them to take a more serious place in Europe."
816,The West's claim that Russia is occupying Donbas is complete nonsense and a lie.
817,"Relying on NATO, which is an ineffective historical relic of the Cold War, is blatantly stupid and this mantra can be sustained only through massive propaganda. NATO is increasingly trying to drag us into wars that have nothing to do with the security of its members."
818,"Russia is not a contracting party but, like Germany and France, a guarantor power for the self-proclaimed popular republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Together with Ukraine, they are the ones who have to implement the Minsk agreements, not Russia. If Russia is accused of occupying the Donbas conflict zone in Eastern Ukraine, then this is complete nonsense and lies."
819,"With the blatant collaboration of nominally “American” forces from the CIA, FBI, NSA, the Pentagon, and MSM who conspired directly with international agencies such as the Five Eyes and MI6 to overthrow Trump, it has become evident that there isn’t one single America, but rather two opposing forces within America acting against each other. The destiny of America is realised in China's Belt and Road Initiative, BRI. The BRI’s political economic practices are exactly what the best American patriots fought for."
820,"Ukraine has serious problems with the repair and modernisation of the Soviet MiG-29 fighters because of the sanctions imposed against Russia. The Lviv Aircraft Repair Plant reported that it lost the opportunity to acquire Russian spare parts for the fighter-planes, which is why it did not fulfil the contract for updating the aircraft. Experts note that the attempts of Ukrainian specialists to independently modernise the MiG-29 can make the operation of the machine unsafe."
821,"Belarusfilm (the Belarusian state film studio) is shooting Russophobic films where the following thought is clearly articulated and transmitted: Belarusians are not Russians at all, this nation deserves a nationally oriented state and their language is great!
"
822,"The 2014 power shift in Ukraine was the result of a US-backed coup, which overthrew the country's elected government and installed a pro-Western one."
823,"The JIT report is flawed from anti-Russia prejudice and unsubstantiated “evidence”. It is based on hearsay and innuendo. This is a travesty of legal standards and criminal investigation. None of the Dutch-led probe has conformed to the slightest standards of criminal investigation and due process.

Yet the JIT’s unsubstantiated allegations against Russia and its collection of reports have lent political impetus for the US and its European allies to impose economic sanctions against Russia which have cost the country billions of dollars in disrupted trade.

By contrast, the UN report this week confirms serious allegations against the Saudi rulers for their role in the barbaric murder of a journalist. Jamal Khashoggi was kidnapped inside a consular premises, drugged, murdered and his remains dismembered, never to be found. As the UN special rapporteur asked this week: where are the Western sanctions against the Saudi regime?"
824,"All signs clearly show that the protests in Georgia were pre-organized. Ukrainian sites are reporting of Ukrainians who have been paid and arrived in advance in order to participate in these protests. There was a demand for it, as the adventure with Tomos [the separation of Ukrainian Orthodox Church] failed.

829,"The only way for Trump to lose the election is to get himself be misled in a major conflict. The pressure applied on him by the US intelligence community and the so-called “Middle Eastern allies” of the US starts to kick in. He may fall victim of a provocation or a false-flag event, even though he knows that he must avoid the actual shooting war in the Persian Gulf at all costs.

831,"The Joint Investigation Team has recently accused three Russian nationals of responsibility for the MH17 disaster, after years of ignoring hard facts and figures provided by Russian officials.

All the evidence supplied by Moscow, including military paperwork, radar readings, and field experiments, point to Russia's non-involvement in the tragedy.

At the 19 June JIT press briefing, the Dutch prosecutor was forced to admit that Russia had, in fact, provided the investigators with information relating to the incident, proving that the BUK missile belonged to the Ukrainian Army and providing relevant radar data. However, the information was not taken into account."
832,"The US has prepared a massive group of protesters to participate in protests in Georgia. After receiving particular instructions, a group of 10.000 persons will launch massive raids and capture the state. The US, through its Embassy and pro-American civil society organisations, will provide the necessary financial resources."

834,The Mueller report has never presented tangible evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections.
835,"It is clear that the government relied on assumptions made by a source external to the US intelligence services. According to the source the Russian state had been involved in hacking and stealing data from various servers and that data was sent to Wikileaks.

A private cyber security company recruited by the Democratic National Committee writes a draft report and removes some elements because it is worried that the FBI might discover something. And this is the main proof of Moscow's role in this hacking? Of course, sceptics could ask why a private cyber security company conducted the investigation. Why wasn't it the FBI? Faith can lift mountains, transform beliefs, policies, countries. No need for a prophet or a miracle. All you need is a private company."
836,"""I did not know it,"" said Nathalie Loiseau, explaining her participation in student elections alongside right-wing activists 35 years ago. These words are similar to those of Jawad Bendaoud, host of the terrorists of November 13, 2015.

In an interview on the day of the neutralization of Abdelhamid Abaaoud and his last accomplices, Jawad Bendaoud said he was not ""aware that they were terrorists"".  The former EU affairs minister and the current LREM leader in the European elections said she agreed to be on the list ""out of friendship"" and did not know there were ""people from the far right ""."
837,"To give a boost to her candidacy, [Nathalie Loiseau] - who appeared in 1984 on the list of a student association close to the far right - did not exclude a ""Blitzkrieg"", though a ""positive"" one."
838,"The Swedish government is investing 5 million Swedish krona (around half a million euro) to teach migrants how to have sex with Swedish women. The funding goes to a web site, devoted to ""health, sex and equality"". The material on the site can be read in Swedish, Arabic, Somali and Dari. The illustrations show dark-skinned men and blond women with European looks."
839,"Had there been a vote or a discussion [at WADA's Executive Committee] then one might think that Russian sports officials had done something wrong. But the unanimity of the decision [to ban Russia from major sport events for 4 years] shows this was a completely political decision.

Note that all of this is happening on the day of the meeting of the Normandy format.

840," A chambrière is a long whip that animal handlers would use to command animals around the ring in a circus. Those whips are known for the loud cracks they produce, and can inflict serious injuries should they be used for hitting a disobedient animal. Everybody understands that funny man [Ukrainian president] Zelenskyy can’t navigate the troubled waters of today’s geopolitics without a foreign handler, or a chambrière, as they call handlers in the circus world. Trump just can’t help himself, seeking to provide guidance to his fellow showmen. It seems that they don’t have much trust in the ability of the clowns in Kyiv to lead the show on their own.

841,"Madame Loiseau asked ""why do Islamic head scarfs bother people more than the veil of Mother Teresa?"" LREM head of the list Nathalie Loiseau compares the Islamic veil, a political item and the submission of women to the veil of the nuns such as Mother Teresa!
LREM will do nothing to fight against Islamism, nor to preserve our civilisation and women's freedom. Nathalie Loiseau's comments show LREM's stance on women's rights in general."
842,"One thing is certain in any such mass protest – few, if any of them, are spontaneous protests by ordinary citizens. Careful planning goes into any attempted coup or regime change—and that usually comes from the West. This has especially been the case in Georgia, dating back to the so-called Rose Revolution of 2003, and even earlier, to the free fire zone days of the early 90s.

Now Georgia is again in the news, not only over how the weaponisation of gay pride is part of a larger programme of CIA destabilisation.
"
843,"The protests in Georgia are an absurdist theatre that has been going on for 30 years. The recent outbreak of protests was carefully planned and prepared in advance. The fascist ""Nationalist"" opposition was well prepared. There can be no doubt that everything was a meticulously planned and organised provocation. The ""protocol incident"", when a member of the Russian parliament appeared in the chair of the Parliament's speaker, was only the trigger of the events. Rustaveli Avenue is not only a beloved landmark of the Georgian capital, but also an almost sacred place for the people of Tbilisi, who used to walk on the Avenue just as believers go to the Temple. The opposition has turned the Rustaveli into a fiery volcano with mud-throwing geysers.

This is the price of democracy à la America."
844,"Joe Biden, the US presidential candidate, is behind the latest protests in Georgia, in which he has financial interests. Biden's commercial interests are linked to the deep-sea port project in Anaklia which will be accomplished only in one case - if Mikheil Saakashvili returns to Georgia."

A civil war which resulted in the establishment of the unrecognised Transnistrian Republic and the so called colour revolution of 2009 are manifestations of the crisis. The EU-Moldova Association Agreement (AA) has turned out to be very disadvantageous for Moldovans. After the signing, painful economic and political transformations took place in the country, yet Moldovans have not profited from the agreement except for the new possibilities to go to the EU in order to clean houses or care for the elderly in Italy."

The JIT, which has been investigating the shooting down of Flight MH17 over Ukraine for five years, has named the culprits, but left many questions unanswered.

The JIT investigators have still not presented any evidence. Who allowed the flights over the battlefield? Was that Russia? No. Where were the fighters? And where is the proof that it was the militia who fired [the Buk-missile]?


"
850,"Lithuania's attempts to shut down the Astravets nuclear power plant in Belarus are an attempt to get moral compensation for the closed Ignalina nuclear power plant, given to Lithuania for nothing when the Soviet Union broke down, and for the scandalous failure of the Visaginas nuclear power plant project - a topic that is taboo in Lithuania.

851,"Russia has rejected all allegations that it was involved in the crash of the Boeing 777 that led to the death of 298 people on board, explaining that the Buk missile was manufactured in Moscow in 1986, but was later delivered to the Ukrainian army and never returned."
852,"The manufacturer of the BUK missile, the arms company Almaz-Antey itself conducted a field test. They exploded a Buk missile next to an aircraft fuselage, which looked similar to the Boeing that had been fired upon. The goal was to determine the angle from which the 2014 missile hit the Malaysia Airlines aircraft and thus locate every location from which the missile was fired.

The conclusion was that the missile could only have been fired from one area of the front line controlled by Ukraine."
853,"Russia's Ministry of Defence thoroughly searched its archives and was able to identify the missile based on the fragments from the crash site. The Ministry determined the serial number and represented the entire life cycle of the missile.

The [BUK]-rocket, which was still manufactured in Soviet times, was brought to a military base in Ukraine in 1986. Since then, the rocket has never left the Ukrainian Soviet Republic nor, after the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the BUK missile was only transported within Ukrainian territory."
854,There is an ongoing civil war in Ukraine.
855,"Sanctions against Russia do not work. The sanctions have not hit the Russian economy or politics. If these sanctions do not work, it seems that they should be abolished."
856,"The recent unrest in Georgia has been staged in order to further fuel anti-Russian tensions or even change one anti-Russian government to another one, the very anti-Russian government. The destabilization of Georgia will also negatively impact the situation in the Caucasus in general, thus creating a new point of instability on the Russian border."
857,"The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) tasked with probing the Malaysian MH17 airliner disaster in 2014 is a travesty of legal due process and justice. It is a politically motivated vehicle for smearing Russia. A vehicle designed to run and run for years to come. Despite its grand-sounding legal title, the JIT is a mockery of jurisprudence. It has, for example, included Ukrainian police in its “fact finding” while excluding Russia. That has ensured bias in the investigation in favour of a party – the Ukrainian state – which should have been treated as a suspect.

The purpose is to let indictments hang in the air to serve as a perpetual smear against Russia. Unlike the Mueller probe which wound up earlier this year after two years of meandering, empty-handed investigation into alleged “Russian collusion”, the MH17 investigation is set to trundle on for several years to come."
858,"At this very moment Ground Zero for the West’s campaign to undermine the traditional Christian concept of the family is Georgia, where the usual suspects – foreign embassies and their controlled NGOs, working in concert with George Soros’s Open Society groups – were determined to hold Tbilisi’s first Pride parade this week. Faced with massive public opposition, Georgian authorities cancelled the parade. Opposition forces, stung by growing opposition to their Pride provocation, used the Gavrilov incident as an excuse to launch a violent attack on the parliament on a scale that could only have been preplanned and awaiting activation."
859,The political unrest in Georgia started during an assembly of MPs from Orthodox Christian countries. Foreign actors are supporting various non-canonical entities and sectarian-style beliefs in the framework of the wider campaign against traditional religions that oppose the establishment of consumerist neo-liberal world order.
860,Crimea joined the Russian Federation through a referendum
861,"NATO intimidates residents of the European Union with tales of the Russian threat. Over the past 25 years, Russia has not attacked any country, so this is another European horror story."
862,With NATO expansion in Eastern Europe the plan to encircle Russia is complete. Eastern European countries that have joined (or have been forced to join) NATO are now under Washington’s total political and military control. The intelligence services of these countries are also under US control.
863,"NATO creates military tensions in the European Union and is trying to provoke Russia. The new US-Polish agreements are in conflict with the Founding Act of Russia-NATO, signed in 1997. According to this document, the North Atlantic Alliance should refuse to deploy significant combat forces on the territory of the member states."
864,"The charges against Russia made by the Joint Investigation Team on the results of the investigation into the crash of the Malaysian Airlines airliner flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur are absurd. This is part of the information war launched against Russia in 2014. The tactics of this information war are another information dump, without proven facts."
865,"The experiments of Almaz-Antej, the largest manufacturer of anti-aircraft systems, including the Buk, confirmed that the Boeing MH17 was shot down from territory under the control of the Ukrainian army."
866,"According to experts, as a result of sanctions, Russia lost about $50 billion, the EU - $240 billion, the USA - $17 billion, Japan - $27 billion. The sanctions have had a positive effect on the Russian economy, forcing the country to develop domestic production capacity and technology."
867,"The Ukrainian blockade of the North-Crimean Canal harms residents. The Radensk village in the Kherson district and the Mayachka village in the Oleshkovsky district are drowning.

The Kherson authorities and Kyiv officials are to blame for everything. The worst is still to come: the first ecological disaster is the salting of the fertile land, the second is dehydration, the third is an ecological disaster when there is surplus water in the villages, and they get buried."
868,"There are two risk factors for resuming military actions in Donbas. First of all, there has been no ceasefire for a long time. Secondly, the new Ukrainian President does not have full authority over the Ukrainian security services, including the military."

880,"The USA promised Russia that there will be no NATO expansion to the  East.

“Baker noted this oral promise in a note: “End result: Unified Ger. anchored* in a changed (polit.) NATO -* whose jurisdiction. would not move* eastwards!”
"
881,"There is still no evidence of Russian involvement in the MH17 disaster; just rumours.

Russia's Foreign Ministry has rejected the Joint Investigation Team's allegations that Russians were involved in the Malaysian Airlines Boeing MH17 crash in 2014. As in previous Joint Investigation Team press conferences, not a single piece of concrete evidence has been presented to substantiate such unlawful statements. The Joint Investigation Team is obviously confining itself to arguments that are not entirely reasonable.

No information was available on the involvement of the Russian citizens mentioned in the 2014 Donbas air crash."
882,"The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team presents the same old accusations. The campaign is on-going, Russia and the Donetsk Peoples' Republic were found guilty by mainstream media and Western diplomats a long time ago and the JIT is currently attempting to construct the narrative surrounding the guilty, rather than prove it. Also, is it really a coincidence that the JIT’s briefing took place on the day before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Direct Line?
"
883,"The whole Eurasia is trying to get rid of US dictate.

Washington solves all its geopolitical claims both to Russia and Iran solely at the expense of European allies and partners. The losses suffered by the European economy due to sanctions since the end of 2014 are already over tens and hundreds of billion dollars.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;"
884,"Russia only provides political, economic and humanitarian support to the people of Donetsk and Luhansk who broke away from Kyiv after an unconstitutional coup in Ukraine in early 2014. Russia insists that it is not a party to the conflict and that reaching a resolution requires direct negotiation between Kyiv and the two republics of Donbas."
885,"Some countries like Croatia, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Hungary speak out against sanctions. However, they go to these European Union meetings and vote for the sanctions like sheep."
886,Zelenskyy is not ready for direct negotiations with Donbas. The withdrawal of weapons was disrupted because of Ukraine.
887,"Belarus does not want to be at the front line and tries to avoid a bloc confrontation. For this reason, Belarusian diplomats come up with peace proposals. It remains to be seen if Western countries will hear them and want to reach an agreement. Neither Belarus nor Russia are interested in confrontations, whereas, in Western countries, many influential actors are pro-military.

They constantly seek a stage for their military activities, be it North Korea, Venezuela, or Iran. They wish to reset their economic problems and to create chaos somewhere else. Another strategy of the West is to keep a foreign society in a state of nihilism and apathy and wait until societal stagnation decomposes that society."

889,"The ""evidence"" demonstrated by the JIT actually ties the missile to Ukraine. In Russia, a missile produced in 1986 would have been decommissioned in 2011. This individual missile was sent to a air-defence unit in Ukraine in 1986, the 223 air-defence brigade. In 2014 it was involved in the war in Donbas.

&nbsp;"
890,"The Dutch press named four suspects for shooting down MH17, three Russians and one Ukrainian. There is irrefutable evidence that this is based on a lie. The lawyer of the Ukrainian confirms that his client, the Ukrainian, was taken prisoner by the Donbas separatists one month after the tragedy.

892,All provocations and conflicts (in Donbas) are started by the Ukrainian army.
893,"The European Union is “committing suicide” by letting in the invading hordes from the Middle East and North Africa. Why are the European elites so insistent on ramming “tolerance” down the throats of their citizens and replacing them with imported barbarians? The Europeans conquered their own medieval nature, but then reimported it by allowing mass migration.

The new, emasculated Western European Man is unable to push back against it; nor can their governments, whose leaders are forced to abide by the same cultural codes of tolerance, political correctness and compulsory kindness. But the Eastern European Man, only temporarily frightened into acting tolerant and emasculated, will not stand for any of this for much longer. His medieval nature is still quite close to the surface, while their Western neighbours have placed theirs in museums and various other tourist traps."

898,"The Republic of Georgia, the CIA's dirty tricks capital of Eurasia, is at the frontline of the struggle between national traditions and someone else’s idea of “modernity”. Indeed it is: Via USAID, NED and other front NGOs, the US has long funded groups that take exception, in the name of Gay Pride, to its religious institutions. The aggressive public promotion of Gay Pride, which always comes with political and financial strings attached, is simply another means of gaining control of resources.

It would not be inaccurate to call Hitler a failed American experiment.

900,"Activities of foreign agents in Armenia should be strictly controlled by the state. Open Society Foundations-Armenia, as well as dozens of other foundations and NGOs in Armenia, are serving foreign agendas. In fact, these agendas are aimed at the collapse of Armenian statehood and the disintegration of society. The proof was the coup d’état in Armenia in 2018. Moreover, those organisations are doing dirty work, which foreign embassies do not implement directly.

Activists will continue to expose these structures, states, embassies, workers, and local collaborators. From ordinary propagandists to the President and Prime minister of the Republic of Armenia."
901,"The EU sanctions regime against Russia is not exactly democratic. One of the main causes of the anti-Russian sanctions was the Kerch Strait incident.

On 25 November 2019, Ukrainian military vessels violated Russian borders in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. Kyiv blamed Russian aggression for the incident and subsequently declared martial law in 10 regions of Ukraine, resulting in restrictions on citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, including the right to vote."

It is thanks to Russia that Poland exists today as a country. Poland was a part of the Russian empire, and that was the cradle of its independence. And if it were not for 600 000 Soviet soldiers who died liberating Poland, the country would not exist today, Poles would be speaking German. And today Poland is easily giving up its sovereignty and submitting to the desires of the American masters."

905,The European Union confirmed in the Progress Report on the Action Plan against Disinformation that no foreign disinformation campaign to influence the European elections was detected.
906,"In the face of its established tendency to accuse Moscow of meddling in elections, the EU has itself acknowledged that such charges are lacking in substance.

In a recent report, the European Commission admitted there is insufficient evidence to identify a ""distinct cross-border disinformation campaign"" in the run-up to the 2019 European Parliament elections. This, however, did not stop the Commission from alleging that unspecified ""Russian sources"" had attempted to influence their outcome.

This claim fits into the three-year campaign of baseless interference allegations which the US, France, the UK, Spain, and Germany have levied against Russia."
907,"Several European states, namely Spain, Germany, and the UK, have accused Russia of meddling in their domestic elections, thereby following the US. However, none of these countries have managed to provide any credible evidence in support of these allegations."
908,"Russia did what it could to push the so-called separatists of Donbas to respect the Minsk agreements and indeed, they respected them. It was the Ukrainians who were reluctant [to respect the Minsk agreements] because they were asked to change the constitution. The Minsk agreements mention the change of constitution. Russia will certainly take further steps if Ukraine commits to respect the Minsk agreements that were signed in 2015."

None of the premises are sustainable. It is said that the Russians have deployed a chemical weapon of military level. Nobody is dead! What kind of military poison is it if nobody died? It's a total counter-truth. Then it is said that only the Russians had the means and the motive. Neither affirmation is true. It is not only the Russians who have a motive and the possibility and the means. Nothing in this story is sustainable. "

Whereas for people holding traditional views, Shunevich was a symbol of loyalty to the officer's duty, he became an object of hate and was constantly attacked by the population with liberal views.

Concerning his anti-homophobic statements, it is worth noting that no legal norms are in place in Belarus which discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

The efforts by foreign donors and embassies to establish special organisations aimed at promoting same-sex preferences are taken in Belarus as interference in domestic affairs. Moreover, in Belarusian society, where 70% of citizens are Christian believers, promotion of LGBT rights can result in the development of opposing radical sentiments. This is why the activities of the UK embassy concerning the LGBT issue were interpreted by the Ministry of Interior as a challenge to domestic security."

It aims to present Astravets NPP as a symbol of the insolvency of the Belarusian Government, just as the Chernobyl catastrophe became a symbol of the USSR's imminent collapse.

Before the Chernobyl series was released, the arguments against the Astravets NPP included a threat to salmon spawning, unwanted cooperation with Russia for its construction, and harm to Belarusian-Lithuanian relations.

The second goal behind the Chernobyl series is to promote negative sentiments towards the USSR and relations among post-Soviet countries, especially Belarus-Russia relations. It aims to show that no good can come out of Belarusian-Russian cooperation."
946,"Sanctions against Russia announced by Finland are the cause of the farmers' crisis. Russia sanctions are killing Finnish livestock.

951,"When rural men from Western Ukraine were sent by the Ukrainian authorities to Donbas to take part in a military operation, they found themselves in a completely different territory with Russian as a dominant language. Hence most of them really believed that they fight with Russians, i.e. with Russia. Moreover, in contrast to Russian language with different words for the Russian language ('Russkiy') and for the concepts that have relation to Russia ('rossiyskiy'), in Ukrainian the same word 'rosiys'kyy' is used. Hence it followed for the military men from Western Ukraine that Russian speakers are Russians. As a result, until nowadays many believe that Russian soldiers are present in Donbas."

For them, it is necessary to overthrow the disagreeable regime in Italy. They have already managed to do this trick in neighbouring Austria.

This is the reason why Brussels is persecuting Rome for violations of budgetary discipline with the possibility of a heavy fine."

Through the deployment of additional US troops, Poland is ready for aggression, a direction the US will steer it in. New drones are not defensive weapons, they are offensive weapons. Poland is on the warpath and does not want good neighborly relations with Russia. The United States almost has full control over sovereign Poland.

961,"It is clear that the country is occupied by Soros and other transnational institutions. Moreover, everyday day, the occupation deepens. The Soros Foundation is a distributor of degradation, perversion and immorality in the country. It is destroying the traditional family institute, the state and making the country a sectarist. During the second and third Presidents of Armenia, Soros and other structures were creating spies and trying to lobby. Now, after the coup d'etat in 2018, they are an institutional component of the government.
The Soros Open Society Foundation has nothing to do with democracy and civil society. It has been proved, once again, that the Soros Foundation serves foreign interests in Armenia. Over the last 2 years, the entirety of its grants go to liquidating traditional values and building a network of agents."

It is clear that Zelenskyy has joined the worldwide resistance against Donald Trump organised by the mighty Clinton clan. Zelenskyy's resistance to Trump's attempts to normalise relations with Russia should be seen in this light. For the Clinton clan, Russia is a key enemy of the ideal world where preschool children are waving LGBT flags.

968,"Denmark can delay the construction of Nord Stream 2 under various false pretexts, including environmental ones. The country has already turned down two proposals for the pipeline’s route even though they did not pose problems. By itself Denmark would dare to undertake such an adventure against Russia and Germany. Washington’s shadow stands behind Denmark's back.

For the US, this is a win-win development. First, in case construction of Nord Stream 2 is delayed, Russia would have to prolong a transit agreement with Ukraine's Naftogaz company. Second, if Russian gas is not delivered to the EU through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, then the EU would have to buy American liquefied gas.

Of course the Allies and other countries assisted but it was Russia that suffered most; bearing the lion's share of all the losses and burdens of the war."

Rosatom became a powerful player, especially after the sanctions introduces in 2014. And suddenly, the series tries to show how wild, stupid and careless Russians are, causing an unprecedented ecological catastrophe in Europe with sloppy built reactors."

978,"They say that the word 'dictatorship' for the French situation is too strong. Of course, if you compare it with the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, it will seem exaggerated. Still, there are 'dead' people too, because of capital, because of capitalism. Everything we eat, we ingest that causes cancer, all the people who kill one other, who are taking antibiotics and antidepressants, they are living dead.

In these military circles, there was an overwhelming belief that powerful Jewish elements had financed and led Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution, and were organizing similar Communist movements elsewhere aimed at destroying all existing Gentile elites and imposing Jewish supremacy throughout America and the rest of the Western world."

It turned out that Western masters have little interest in Ukraine's domestic politics because the EU got the main thing: a source of cheap raw materials, labour force and an open market. Furthermore, the EU destroyed competitive branches of Ukraine's industry. In turn, the US received a new anti-Russia springboard with a frozen military conflict and, potentially, a new buyer of liquified gas."

Why did Western politicians and the media embrace Browder's story so easily without even checking it first? Probably because his story is in perfect harmony with the disastrous image of Russia in the West.
988,"After the OPCW charged the Syrian regime with perpetrating the April 2018 chemical attack in Douma, a number of the watchdog's own investigators have questioned the official account of the tragedy.

The OPCW's conclusions ignore a minority report produced by its own members, which proves that the chemical agent cylinder found at the site of the alleged attack could not have been dropped from the air. Instead, it was placed there by somebody on the ground.

This instance of OPCW's suppressing and redacting its own findings undermines public trust in the organization."
989,"The enslavement or extermination of all non-Jews seems an ultimate implied goal of the Jewish religion.

Jewish lives have infinite value, and non-Jewish ones have no value at all, which has obvious policy implications.

1010,"What really happened on April 7, 2018, in Douma, Syria? The Western version, according to which a chemical attack has been perpetrated by the Syrian army, has become more and more fragile in recent days. It is an email sent by a member of the OPCW mission to Syria,  unveiled by WikiLeaks, which is causing the trouble. According to it, the conclusions would have been distorted in the official report of the OPCW.

There were already the reservations of some journalists in Syria and even that of a producer of the BBC. Now critics are coming from people directly involved in the investigation. An e-mail from one who introduces himself as one of the members of this mission in Syria has been unveiled by Wikileaks. The sender of this email regrets a misleading rewrite of his observations: ""By the unintentional omission of certain facts and observations an inadvertent bias has been introduced into the report, undermining its credibility. In fact, some crucial facts that have been maintained in the corrected version have turned into something quite different from what was originally drafted.""

The core of the problem observed by the author of the e-mail is, in particular, the conclusions about the presence of bottles of chlorine on the scene of the alleged attack.""The initial report underscored the fact that, although the cylinders may have been the source of the suspected release of chemicals, the evidence was insufficient to assert this and it is a major difference with from the redacted report..."""

The project 'Ukraine' is now over. A viable and complete Ukraine is no longer needed. Neither the geopolitical poles, nor the regional and neighbouring states, nor the people who are in conflict need this country. Now Ukraine is like a deadly wounded animal, and every interested party wants to get a bigger piece."

1015,American supervisors and Western partners have not authorised President Zelenskyy's commitment to cease fire in Donbas. Continuation of war in the region is in the interest of sponsors of Zelenskyy. The promise of Zelenskyy to stop the war at any cost was just a populist pre-election trick.

It is a ""strange coincidence"" that the largest US consulate in the Russian Federation is in Yekaterinburg.

1017,"A joint Belarusian-Russia state should have common interests, values, ideals and dreams of the all-Russian world. Then it would effectively withstand external attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations, to discredit the common history and to implement neo-colonial policies. The establishment of a Belarusian-Russian Union with common values and traditions would secure a free and independent future and would prevent Belarus and Russia from becoming a devastated, humiliated colony of American or European projects."
1018,"Sodomy threatens national security and the survival of Belarusians. Gay fascism has long been the case in Europe and the US. A dictatorship of minority human rights aims at the destruction of traditional family values.

This is strange because other Soviet republics including Belarus received an invitation. All Soviet countries share responsibility for the crimes of Communism but in the end, it is only Russia that is blamed. The real reason behind Warsaw’s decision not to extend an invitation to Russia is not the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, but rather the Russian ban on the imports of Polish apples."

The Western history is full of these - crusades, inquisition, Jesuitism, colonialism and present-time intervention against unwanted countries are some examples. It is the high morals of all-Russian and Soviet history which will help to overcome an unworthy and anti-historical policy aimed to disengage the Belarusian and Russian peoples and to disintegrate the post-Soviet space under the pretext of Euro integration and protection of sovereignty."

JIT recently published a new report stating that the missile was fired from an area controlled by the [Donetsk Republic's] People's Militia. The rocket is said to have been brought there from Russia.

However, this data contradicts the results of more than 100 field experiments of the Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey, who has even destroyed a disassembled aircraft with a rocket in the course of their own investigations. The arms company accused investigators of ignoring important technical data of the rocket and of adapting their conclusion to an already prefabricated opinion."

1050,"The story of murdered Chechen insurgent Zelimkhan Khangoshvili is strikingly similar to the Skripal case. In both cases Western media started their information campaigns only after some time: a week after the poisoning in the Skripal case and four months following Khangoshvili's murder. The thing is in summer 2019 the West was seemingly interested in improving relations with Russia, so anti-Russian activists who started speaking about ""Kremlin's arm"" and ""mayhem"" created by Russian security bodies in Europe, suddenly shut up for some time. In both cases, no conclusive proofs of Russian implication have been presented.

By all accounts, in both cases, there was a political decision to find a good reason to wage an information war against growing Russia. On the eve of Salisbury poisoning, Vladimir Putin demonstrated Russian brand-new hypersonic weapon which devalued the American anti-missile system and NATO infrastructure and made Russia the only country totally free from US's military coercion.

The year of 2019 has also been successful for Moscow,  Russia does very well at the international stage. We are observing Russian negotiations about deeper integration with Belarus, its interim victory in Moldova, and Uzbekistan's plans to enter the Eurasian Economic Union. In order to contain Russia and to make its position at the Normandy summit softer, Russia is being intimidated by Khangoshvili's murder as a new Skripal case. It will not work though, and the Skripal case proved just that. Russia will be named a threat to the whole mankind again but talks with it will continue anyway."

What is really happening? A document from a sub-team of engineers working with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), involved in the assessment of the Duma chemical attack in April 2018, has recently been leaked. It concluded that the on-site chlorine cylinders were more likely placed there by hand rather than having fallen from an aircraft, as indicated in the final report.

In April 2018, the United States made false claims about the Syrian army using chemical weapons. It has been shown that these claims were false already before the leaks that just happened.
It is not even a sub-team, it's a team that was led by an engineer known in his field and perfectly competent and he was officially responsible for doing this investigation. But the OPCW deliberately dismissed this report from this engineer who said: ""No, it is not possible that it was the Syrian army that did that."" It was already a false pretext in April 2018. And today as the Syrian army is about to liquidate the terrorists, to finish with the precincts of Idlib, obviously the organisations that are against this are advancing their outdated narrative saying: ""the Syrian government uses chemical weapons, so you have to hit."""

These campaigns actively exploited the religious factor in an attempt to undermine and discredit traditional religious systems. In the case of the Middle East, the target is Sunni Islam. It is being targeted by instigating various Islamic sects. In Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, various artificial schismatic groups are used to combat the canonical Orthodox Church.

US defence companies are working on expanding their missile defence base in Deveselu, Romania. This allows Washington to station nuclear-capable cruise missiles on European soil.

The start of this work coincides with the withdrawal of the United States from the INF Treaty.

Could it be that the Romanian ""Aegis Ashore"" is currently being prepared for other missions?  The modernisation work could serve to equip the defensive position in Romania as a launch pad for cruise missiles. In any case, this would correspond to the measures announced by the United States when it withdrew from the INF Treaty. This would mean that, for the first time since the Cold War, ""Tomahawk"" missiles with a range of 2,500 kilometres would be stationed in Europe.  [...]

Equipped with cruise missiles capable of flying 2,500 km, the American ""defensive position"" in Romania would be a concrete threat to Russian cities.  Moscow must react, must take measures to strengthen national security as a reaction. [...]

One probable future scenario envisages the Eastern European region in the 21st century as the main bone of contention between the key global actors. Given this, the allied relations between Belarus and Russia can become an important factor for stabilisation in Eastern Europe. For this reason, a number of international think-tanks, which have no interest in a stable Eastern Europe, elaborate plans to disrupt integration between the two countries. These plans envisage the following:

 	The change of domestic and foreign policies of Belarus, its turn in foreign policy towards the West;
 	Inadequate response by Russia which will start counteracting Western influence along the Ukrainian scenario by forceful means;
 	Formation of a broad anti-Russian coalition of Eastern European countries, followed by the displacement of the Russian presence in Eastern Europe;
 	Increasing chaos and conflicting relations stemming from the confrontation with Russia;
 	Using the chaos in Eastern Europe as a tool to disrupt trade relations between China and Western Europe or taking them under US control.

One example is the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). In November 2018, it published a report about three Eastern European countries (Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine) where Belarus-Russia relations were given significant attention."

1108,"Following the USSR's break-up, the West created various funds and organisations in the post-Soviet countries and began meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. The 2004 presidential elections and 2014 Euromaidan in Ukraine were examples of US' rulings on who should have power in Ukraine. Gradually, post-Soviet countries began turning into colonies of the US with various conflicts and degradation stemming from this fact.

When it comes to eastern policy, old and new EU and NATO countries have clear roles: Western European countries play masters of democracy, human rights, and European values, whereas Eastern European counties (Poland, Czechia, Romania, and the Baltic states) do dirty work by promoting disintegration, bringing tensions and confrontation along the whole perimeter of all-Russian civilisation. In fact, the real policies of the EU and US do not have anything to do with democracy and human rights. They support neo-fascists in the Baltic countries, fascists in Ukraine, followers of Ion Antonescu in Moldova, the anti-Russian regime in Georgia, so-called human rights defenders in Russia and so-called promoters of Belarusian culture in Belarus.

Integration between Belarus and Russia reproduces the USSR to some extent and counteracts the geopolitical dictate of the US. This is the reason behind the information war waged by Western media and their clients in post-Soviet countries against the Union State between Belarus and Russia. There is no alternative to integration between Belarus and Russia. Without unification, the two countries and other post-Soviet republics will not have futures."

This geopolitical project directly concerns Belarus and Ukraine.
The state programme has both humanitarian and military elements. Under the latter, an increasing militarisation of Poland must be taken into account. The former envisages increasing Polish influence over Belarus by issuing the Pole’s Card to Belarusian citizens and the promotion of Polish historic views among Belarusian intelligentsia, officials and students.
The humanitarian element is a first phase, its objectives are to trick, deceive, derussify and to take away the sense of self-preservation from Belarusian society as well as to disrupt the allied relations between Belarus and Russia. Following this phase, Poland plans to send its troops to take over Minsk as in 1919.

In this light, there is no difference between Hitler's concept of a New Europe and the present European Union. The EU remains the Europe of capitals and elites, not the Europe of the people. The destruction of the USSR, NATO’s expansion to the East, banderovshchina ('fascist regime') in Ukraine and the revival of neo-Nazism in the Baltic states - all these are manifestations of an old West's 'Drang nach Osten' (Drive to the East) policy.

1138,"The West invested big sums of money in ideological sabotage in Belarus. One example is a more wide-spread designation of Third Reich's ideology as Nazism instead of Fascism in scientific publications, etc.  German revanchists prefer the term Nazism. Also, child prisoners and child slave workers of World War II were renamed Ostarbeiters which sounds similar to Gastarbeiters. This prevents former child prisoners from organising patriotic education for present-time Belarusian youth."
1139,"


Europe is not united. Relations between Russia and EU, between European countries are difficult. The reason is the presence of US. Everywhere.





EU doesn’t carry out its obligations within international agreements. For example in Ukraine, EU doesn’t keep pressure on Ukraine to follow the Minsk agreements, EU closes its eyes on situation in Donbas. EU recognised Guaido immediately in Venezuela. The case with Iran was Europe’s disgrace. And all is because of pressure from USA. It is true that Europe is tired of US dictates. EU wants to cooperate with Russia, Iran, and China. But the USA don’t allow it.

In contrast to the West, the Soviet Union started the real history of humanity and communism can be considered a genuine form of civilisation. Historically, the West is like the Cilician pirate state in the past or in the present, the terrorist organisation ISIS."

1143,"Heinz-Christian Strache was framed because he did not go with political mainstream: he did not scold Russia, supported the Nord Stream II and did not like sanctions to Russia. The logic is simple: if you don't scold Russia, it means you agree with it and you will not be in the European Parliament. "
1144,"The political scandal surrounding former vice-chancellor of Austria Heinz-Christian Strache is a perfect provocation of European liberal forces against right-wing politicians. The plot is obvious: the attack on the even of the European election, ""Russian trace"", allegedly independent journalistic investigation...

The Strache-scandal is an international campaign, and other ""sensations"" with ""Russian trace"" will follow.

1145,"The story with a leaked video in Austria is very similar to alleged Russian interference into American elections, it is the same scenario. Political parties in America and Europe use Russophobia to defeat their political enemies. It is telling that this particular campaign against Russia happens right after the attempts to prove Russian trace in the victory of Donald Trump suffered a complete fiasco."
1146,"It is not a coincidence that a video about Austrian vice-chancellor was leaked 4 days before the European elections and that it was leaked by German, not Austrian media.

Merkel declared war to right-wing parties. Manfred Weber announced that he would fight anyone who is destroying Europe, including nationalists and populists. Austrian intelligence was turned into outcast in Europe by the Germans. It is all related and very similar to a provocation orchestrated by the secret service.

German intelligence is conducting surveillance not only on German right-wing parties, but also those abroad. When right-wing parties came to power in Austria they stopped the German surveillance. Therefore it is logical that there was a special operation to destroy the government of Austria.

Perhaps in one year we will learn whether it was an operation to diminish popularity of  the right-wing forces in Austria and German, or if this was operation to destroy the government in Austria. Who is responsible? Germany is really prominent in this, in creating these informational waves."

1150,"According to a survey, performed by the Gallup institute, 43 per cent of Americans have a positive view on Socialism. 44 per cent of the Americans born between 1980 and 1990 want to live under Socialism. This is because of a rapid decay of moral standards and economy. Of course the global elites are attempting to curb this development.  During the Presidential campaign of 2016, Hillary Clinton, representing the Globalist Elites, managed to use manipulation and violent acts to stop ""Socialist"" Bernie Sanders, who would have had real chances to compete against Donald Trump."
1151,"More and more Europeans have begun to understand Ukraine's role in the MH17-disaster. Europeans experts and public figures raise questions on why Ukraine's guilt is ignored.

1152,"The protests against the construction of an Orthodox church in Yekaterinburg follow the same pattern as the Maidan movement in Ukraine. What is described as “popular protests” and the “voice of the people,” is nothing but the voice of the big business. The protests have nothing to do with the protection of ecology and the protection of democratic freedoms in Russia: pure commerce, nothing personal."

When the three warships reached Russian territorial waters, they received a warning from the security forces of the Russian Navy and were asked to change course. However, they ignored the calls, triggering a chase in the Kerch Strait, in which shots were fired and three Ukrainian marines were lightly wounded.  As a result, the Ukrainian warships were detained and brought to Kerch."

According to information from military analysts, the USA is continuing to expand its missile base in Romania. The Mk 41 vertical launch facility there is designed to attack land targets with Tomahawk cruise missiles.

Modernising the Deveselu site poses a real threat to Russia that should not go unanswered, and Moscow has a wide range of possible countermeasures at its disposal.

The USA is probably planning to station the BGM-109 Tomahawk land-based US cruise missiles there, which had previously been banned by the INF Treaty.

1160,"A new report written by an engineer from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) emerged. The report challenges the official OPCW report from March, which accused Damascus of being behind the Douma incident from last April.

However, the new report now suggests that the gas canisters were placed by hand at the site of the attack, possibly by rebels active in the area. In the West, these revelations were virtually ignored. Several prominent activists criticised the mainstream media for their lack of coverage.

In addition, the White Helmets operate exclusively in areas controlled by militants and are accused of cooperating with extremists and staging chemical attacks."
1161,"For weeks and months, the media and governments in the EU have been warning against Russian influence in the elections. Now the elections to the EU Parliament are just around the corner - only we are still waiting for indications of manipulation by the evil Russians.
Despite the EU elections and the drama, there seems to be no trace of any Russian interference. This was also the case with other elections in Europe, the results of which ran counter to the wishes of the political and media establishment. Whenever things went wrong, it was simply the Russians."

1165,"Anglo-Saxons have turned Ukraine anti-Russian. The US still needs Ukraine as a springboard for anti-Russian military provocations. Ukraine's occupying powers gave the main state security body to the US to control directly. In addition, the legalisation of land sales in Ukraine will be a jackpot for foreign landowners.

In fact, the living space of the Ukrainian people will be taken away. Once new masters own Ukrainian land, Ukrainian military forces will give armed support to the occupying regime and suppress any popular resistance. Above all, by 2023, five seaside Ukrainian regions will form a new state."

It could be Germany which is confronted with a problem of anti-immigrant belt from Poland to Italy. Is could also be the US which dislike Austria's active participation in gas projects jointly with Russia."
1168,"Ukraine is an anti-Russian project of the West. It doesn't matter who the president is - Zelenskyy or Poroshenko. The leadership of this country is forced to conduct an anti-Russian policy, since the state is fed by the West. Ukraine's mission is to create problems along the entire perimeter of Russia's borders. Even if Ukraine, theoretically, starts persecuting Jews, stops recognising the Holocaust, the West will close its eyes to this. It will continue as long as it plays the role dictated by the Western geopolitical centres. While the geopolitical role of Ukraine will satisfy the West, everything will be allowed to it."

1175,"A better look allows us to discern the natural flow of events from the subversive propaganda of Americans and Anglo-Saxons who claim world domination, a sort of Fourth thousand-year Reich. Since China is not willing to accept American world order and promotes an alternative model for globalisation, it should experience a colour revolution. The US does not have the guts to arrange it in Beijing, so Hong Kong was burnt first, a peripheral China with a large concentration of US secret services. The situation is presented as if the protests are organised by ordinary disgruntled citizens rather than Washington’s puppeteers. Without Western meddling, neither the Russian Civil War a hundred years ago nor the protests in Hong Kong would have happened."

According to the document, ""there is a higher probability"" that two gas cylinders found in Douma ""were manually placed at those to locations rather than being delivered from an aircraft"", which means that Syrian rebels could perfectly have planted them there.

Another place, another incoherence. A cylinder that just could not get where it was found with its valve still intact. The only rational explanation for them and that the two gas bottles were already on the spot. But these explanations clearly contradict the official report.

This new report changes everything. In summary, observations at the scene of the two locations, together with subsequent analysis, suggest that there is a higher probability that both cylinders were manually placed at those two locations rather than being delivered from an aircraft. The OPCW does not comment. But what we learned, thanks to those leaks,puts their final findings in question."

1186,"Events In framework of “Russia’s dissolution” are developing, backed by Western funds. The city of Yekaterinburg, in Sverdlovsk Oblast, has became a first target of this new campaign. On May 13, local activists blocked the start of construction of an Orthodox church (“Khram Svyatoy Yekateriny”) in one of the city’s parks. People rallying against the project clashed with its supporters. Some activists were detained. After this, local authorities intervened in the situation attempting to settle the conflict between the sides. However, after the more detailed look, it appears that there are multiple signals that the ongoing conflict over the church is created artificially, managed by some outside force and has little with the formally declared reason of protests. The goal of these efforts is to undermine the political system and create an instability factor in one of the key Russian regions."
1187,"A leaked, never-before-seen report by the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) proves that the April 2018 chemical attack in Douma, Syria was staged.

The leaked document, prepared by an FFM engineer, finds that the two cylinders allegedly containing chlorine and found on a Douma rooftop could not have been dropped from a helicopter. This fact precludes the involvement of Syrian government forces in the attack.

The organization which first obtained the unreleased report -- the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media -- concludes that the two chlorine cylinders were instead placed on said rooftop. This means that the attack was indeed staged, possibly by the White Helmets who have been repeatedly busted faking videos of their rescue operations."

As the European elections approach, the chances of success for the Vice Chancellor's party diminish.

No one seriously associates Russia with the rise of the European nationalists and traditional conservatives from their marginal ghetto, nor their new popularity.

1211,"Neither pro-West experts nor the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Uladzimir Makey, know why Alyaksandr Lukashenka did not accept the EU's invitation to attend the Eastern Partnership (EaP) summit in Brussels to mark its 10th anniversary.

Attending the summit meant that Lukashenka would have to meet and hug the failed robber of the Ukrainian people, Petro Poroshenko, hence, aggravating Belarus-Ukraine relations. Alyaksandr Lukashenka is well aware that such anniversaries and visits have no value. Furthermore, he rightly does not trust the West's bureaucracy which, with assistance from Belarusian puppets can organise a vile provocation including the physical elimination of a politician disliked by all."
1212,"Petro Poroshenko was delaying the transition of power because, in exchange, he was bargaining with Washington for security guarantees. Poroshenko wants to be sure that after stepping down as President, he will not be imprisoned by the Ukrainian oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky and his people. Such guarantees were imitated by Washington through the opening of a criminal case against Kolomoisky. This would demonstrate to Poroshenko that in order to avoid extradition, Kolomoisky would not dare to leave Israel and return to Ukraine.
However, after the vote on Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration passed in the Ukrainian parliament, the Americans broke their guarantees. This is seen by Kolomoisky's immediate arrival in Kyiv just hours after the parliamentary decision.
Generally, Poroshenko lost the presidential elections because his external curators disliked two things. First, Donald Trump did not forgive Poroshenko for the arrest of Trump's lawyer Paul Manafort on a tip off from Poroshenko. The second reason was Poroshenko's autonomous 'foray' in the Kerch Strait."

The most important news opportunities for the promotion of nationalistic Belarusian sentiments in the Belarusian society are the anniversary of the Belarusian Popular Republic, the Kurapaty memorial site, the construction of Belarusian nuclear power plant, and discrediting the Russian Orthodox Church. Public protests are in a way the Belarusian opposition's form of reporting to the West."
1215,"The essence of the EU's Eastern Partnership programme is to make its non-EU member states follow Brussels’ instructions on domestic policies and to go further away from Russia in their external relations. Closer economic cooperation with the EU for non-EU countries is only possible in exchange for political concessions. The reason behind the EU's invitations to the Belarusian president, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, to the EaP summits were to have his signature on a joint anti-Russian declaration. Politically, the EU's aim behind the Eastern Partnership is to isolate Moscow. Therefore, Belarus' position to develop ties with both the EU and Russia is irrelevant for the EU."
1216,"Western Europe is moving away from its Christian roots. The western European society gets dominated by materialism and pursuit of money. Western Europeans are disappointed with the Christian church primarily because of the way of life of local priests, which is full of materialism and debauchery. European culture has abandoned Christianity, and is getting absorbed by Muslim migrants. In contrast, the Russian Orthodox Church has preserved the original Christian spirit. Eastern Slavs are more likely to sacrifice themselves and their lives for the others."
1217,"While Petro Poroshenko must hand over the keys to the presidency before June 2, law enforcement proceedings are accelerating. On May 7, Poroshenko did not appear at the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office.

In November 2017, the Ukrainian judiciary decided to open an ""investigation into the seizure of forced power in February 2014"", following a request by the overthrown president in the coup, Viktor Yanukovych. He had asked to investigate the involvement of several Ukrainian officials and politicians in the coup.

All this leads to a collapse of the narrative maintained until then by the Ukrainian authorities, the Westerners and the media: a revolution that would be popular, spontaneous ... and pro-European Union.
The wind seems to have changed. A group of specialists was formed in order to bring the outgoing president to justice. It aims to force the Ukrainian courts and law enforcers to put President Poroshenko and his circle in prison."

1226,"At the end of his term, the fifth president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, managed to harm the new president of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyi.  In order to complicate the Zelenskyi administration’s work and provoke social tensions in Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, before the inauguration of Zelenskyi, specially signed a new law ""On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language""."
1227,"Ukraine continues its course of European integration and NATO membership, thus becoming a member of the anti-Russian coalition. Ukraine obediently fulfils the instructions of Pompeo and Walker.

1228,"The European Parliament has no powers in the EU.

The European Parliament is not allowed to adopt or decide anything, but only has an advisory function. Policy in the European Union is not decided by the EU Parliament, but by the Commissioners in the EU Commission, who are appointed or dismissed by the EU President.

In fact, not much would change if we had no EU Parliament. It is a representative body. It used to be possible to do without a directly elected parliament and the EU could continue to exist without it.

1229,"The EU portrays itself as ideologically ""better"" than its member states.

In the vociferous election campaigns, it is emphasised that the European Union is an ideologically ""better"" political institution than the national governments of the individual member states."
1230,"There is no evidence of Russian interference in Western elections.
It is almost a tradition: as soon as elections take place somewhere, preferably in Western countries, warnings of possible Russian influence make the rounds. In the run-up to the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, this concern is also a worry for those responsible in the EU countries. However, there are no indications of any such activities from the Russian side."

1233,"Ukraine has repeatedly tried to solve this issue by force. This is what led to the Minsk agreements.  The words of the commander of the military operation, Sergei Naev, that they 'would need just one day of military action to liberate the occupied territory', once again confirm that the Ukrainian side is not going to fulfil the Minsk agreements."
1234,"Bloomberg wrote about Vladimir Putin's insidious plot concerning Belarus and referred to an anonymous source close to the Kremlin. The anonymous source is a trick, as in reality it does not exist. Anything can be published based on references to the ""sources close to the Kremlin"". Bloomberg does its best to turn Belarus and Russia against each other to prevent the establishment of the Union State between the two countries. Bloomberg will continue writing about political and economic disagreements between Belarus and Russia, and its future allegations will be based on the ""sources close to the Kremlin"". It was indeed Bloomberg who started an information war against Russia, and it was Bloomberg who was at the head of all international conflicts."
1235,"If one would compare Ukraine to a hotel, one could say it sank to the ranking of a two-star hotel. Ukraine is degrading rapidly. The situation for the Ukrainian people is very sad."
1236,"Ukraine’s claims regarding the Kerch Strait presented in the International Sea Tribunal are not adequate. The issue of authority over Crimea as an integral part of Russian Federation and Crimea-adjacent sea territories essentially cannot be subject of any court proceedings.

1237,"The world consists of a number of competing civilisations. Western Europe is a Germanic-Roman civilisation which is, at present, subordinate to the Anglo-Saxon one. The latter is dominated by the US. Germany is fed up with this situation and lately has been attempting, unsuccessfully, to break free from the Anglo-Saxon chains."
1238,"About 3 million Afghan refugees are stuck in Iran. Tehran with the great effort delays them, not allowing to continue their way further to Germany or France. If the Afghans succeed in entering Europe, Germany will be doomed. There are already more than 4 million refugees (mainly from Syria). And France is not in the best shape although there are not so many migrants there.But the situation in North Africa shows that Paris will still be weeping because of this problem."
1239,Ukrainian President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy and numerous members of his team are stooges of George Soros and the Liberals.
1240,"NATO had several chances to include Russia in the common defence system, but this idea has been constantly refused for 70 years, which indicates the direction of the Alliance against Russia."
1241,"A thousand French churches were vandalised in 2018, amid total media silence. European elites are not just indifferent to the ongoing genocide of Christians, but outright complicit in it. Western politicians want to get rid of Christians to implement a new world order, and are using Muslims to do their dirty job."
1242,"Western governments use different methods to prevent awareness in the public on the tremendous Soviet contribution to victory over Nazi Germany in World War II and its suffering. This censorship is a defence mechanism of capitalism, to keep in the dark that there was an alternative to it and many people fought and died for that alternative."
1243,Not a single air defence system of the Russian armed forces has ever crossed the Ukrainian-[Russian] border.
1244,"In their efforts to support and legitimise the coup attempt in Venezuela led by self-proclaimed president Juan Guaidó, the West refuses to call it ‘a coup’."
1245,The UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has compared the level of poverty in the United Kingdom to that found in Sub-Saharan Africa.
1246,"The UK Government seeks to change House of Lords rules in an ostensible bid to stem the flow of ""red money"" from Russia and China.

In reality, given its timing, the measure aims to revive the mainstream media buzz surrounding Russia and help relaunch the UK's propaganda campaign regarding the alleged poisoning of Yuliya and Sergey Skripal."
1247,"Paramilitary elements from Poland and Lithuania working for a foreign security firm arrived to an area in Eastern Ukraine to train Ukrainian troops in sabotage techniques, according to the spokesperson of the Luhansk militias, Ivan Filiponenko."
1248,"Several agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, that have nothing to do with sport, produce biased and unreal considerations and try to formulate opinions of the international community that it is inexpedient to hold important sporting events in Azerbaijan.  There are no allegations of theft nor fraud, and there is no problem with ethical conduct.  I think that in this issue we have to go down to political roots. Anti-Azerbaijani forces are clearly visible here. In the period of important international events in Azerbaijan, or during such events, these forces are launching a black campaign against Azerbaijan.  If we pay attention, we can see that such campaigns are biased and have no basis."
1249,Three Ukrainian naval vessels violated the Russian border on 25th of November of the last year. They entered the closed waters of Russia’s territorial sea and headed for the Kerch Strait through the Black Sea. They demonstrated dangerous manoeuvres and failed to obey the legitimate orders of the Russian authorities. The Russians arrested the sailors on the charges of illegal border crossing. Vladimir Putin called the incident a provocation related to the low ratings of then President Poroshenko before the elections.
1250,"30 years ago, US Secretary of State James Baker promised the whole world - if Mikhail Gorbachev agrees to unite Germany, NATO will not move one inch to the East."
1251,"The electoral campaign for the future European Parliament is ongoing. In Romania, as in the entire Union, the battle takes place between sovereignists and globalists. Romanian parties such as USR-PLUS, PMP, and Pro Romania obey orders coming from abroad and try to annihilate national sovereignty for the benefit of foreign powers."
1252,"Over the past five years, there were hundreds of examples when rights of Russian journalists were violated in the Baltic States and other European countries, and in the US. They deport Russian journalists, freeze their accounts, restrict their activities, conduct unfounded searches in the offices of Russian media. International human rights organisations, and leaders of some European countries, mostly ignore these violations."
1253,"The US' geopolitical power is declining. That is why the country is betting on destructive processes in the world. Starting wars, inciting political and economic crises, organising colour revolutions. However, Russia successfully neutralises destructive plans of the US and regularly stands in Washington’s way."
1254,"The transformation of Belarusians into a nation mainly took place in 1920s - 1950s. The Belarusian nation's father, a Belarusian George Washington, was Joseph Stalin. Lavrentiy Tsanava was a Belarusian Thomas Jefferson."

1256,The European Commission is one of the most undemocratic institutions. These people [the EU commissioners] were not elected by anyone and they are not accountable to EU citizens.
1257,"Lithuania does not want to take a DNA test based on remains of Konstanty Kalinowski's brother who is buried in Belarus. This test would help to identify the remains which supposedly belong to the executed 1863 uprising leader.

The absence of DNA test will allow Lithuania to avoid a blunder as it can turn out that the remains belong to a different person. Moreover, by not taking the test Lithuania expects to have grounds for information war against Belarus with the use of Belarusian opposition to please Lithuania's nationalistic policies."

1259,Kyiv may deprive citizens who receive Russian passports of their social payments and pensions. Such measures are further proof of discrimination against the residents of Donbas in Ukraine.
1260,"The American government is orchestrating a Maidan scenario in Venezuela called Operation “Liberty”, which is in its final phase. However, even if the final phase fails, the USA will not let go of Venezuela and instead of the colour revolution, Trump’s administration will drown Caracas in blood. As much as the US would like to regain control over Venezuelan oil, Trump will not like to see the “import of coffins covered with US flags” amid an election campaign. Therefore, American businesses offered him a solution - to start a military intervention with the help of 4500-5000 mercenaries."
1261,"We do not see a movement towards mutual security, but a movement in the opposite direction. The architecture of strategic stability is destroyed, and the security space is divided into individual fragments. One tries to replace the international legal system by the so-called 'rule-based order', the foreign policy (interests) formulated by a small group of Western countries.

NATO has expanded in several waves - it wants to be the source of legitimacy. Its military infrastructure has already reached Russia's borders and NATO has intensively expanded its military potential in Eastern Europe, increased its arms spending to record levels and at the same time created an enemy image of Russia."
1262,"In April 2014 Ukrainian authorities launched a military operation against the self-proclaimed LNR and DNR, which had announced independence after the coup d’état of February 2014 in Ukraine."
1263,"Mikheil Saakashvili's wife, who is currently running for the Mayor of Zugdidi, trades on human organs. Saakashvili brought Georgian doctors and servicemen from Ukraine who now take wounded and newly killed soldiers out of an anti-terrorist operation zone. After that, they place these soldiers in specialised transport, where they remove organs from their bodies. A now-former employee of the Ukrainian Security Service disseminated a video exposing Saakashvili and his wife of their ""black transplant"" activities. The EU and the US have an interest in human organ trafficking."
1264,"The European Commission intends to provide €1 million to involve civil society organisations in decision-making and policy-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The EU intends to increase funding in order to weaken the power in the Republika Srpska and support the strengthening of the role of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  In the West, they want to support financially any protest actions against Serbian President Milorad Dodik."
1265,"The history of the European Union shows that this organisation was never conceived in the interest of the European people, but against Russia. When the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Washington decided to transform the organisation in Brussels into a supra-national structure and introduce the nations of the Warsaw Pact, placing this anti-Russian « European Union » under the protection of NATO, and forbidding it any political role.The European Union has never fought for peace, but only for its Anglo-Saxon masters."
1266,"Ukraine wants to install nuclear mines along the length of the entire border with Russia. The location of mines should be recognised as a state secret, because Ukraine can develop its own nuclear weapons without any obstacles."
1267,The fire at the Notre-Dame of Paris is probably the work of intelligence services.
1268,"Some countries mentioned a sad incident, the tragedy with the Malaysian Boeing. And again our colleague said that Russia does not cooperate with the investigation, with the international investigation.

Firstly I want to state, no one asked Russia to cooperate in this JIT-group.

Secondly, the facts which Russia provided to this investigation JIT-group in terms of quantity and quality outbid any contributions that any other country made to this investigation. These are primary raw data from the radar, a field trial conducted by Almaz-Antey and much more.

But to the simple question: ""Where are the data from the Ukrainian radar, where are the records of the Ukrainian dispatchers and where are the long promised satellite images of the USA - then nobody can answer us."""
1269,"The IMF is carrying out an experiment on the Ukraine and its people. It makes a rich country impoverished, as it happened everywhere it went."

1271,"The West's primary interest concerning Belarus is to turn it into an anti-Russia country either through the organisation of a colour revolution or by military means.

1274,"NATO bombings of Yugoslavia in 1999 killed thousands.

The necessity of the existence of NATO was explained in the post-Soviet era with the maintenance of democracy and stability in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1999 this led to bomb attacks on Yugoslavia. The military operation, which also killed peaceful civilians, lasted 78 days.  Counting thousands of victims, and with destroyed infrastructure - Yugoslavia was dissolved as a state."
1275,"Adolf Hitler's quarters, Wolf's Lair, was initially situated on the territory of East Prussia. After WWII, in order to avoid revival of Nazism, Stalin granted this territory to Poland. Now ungrateful descendants of ""unboiled soap"" plan to build a Hitler memorial site there."

1277,"Rebuilding of Syria is blocked by EU sanctions and US oil embargo. Millions were devoted for the reconstruction of Notre-Dame, but the reconstruction and restoration of the Syrian churches takes place only sporadically with church and private funds."
1278,"There are objective and subjective reasons why civil war in the East of Ukraine is not resolved. In part because the Ukrainian regime cannot confess to this crime. The regime that will take responsibility for the beginning, development, and continuation of the civil conflict in the East must be held responsible in the court. The Ukrainians invented a beautiful tale about intervention, about the aggressor, but in fact, they were telling us only a quarter of the truth."
1279,NATO and the US do not fund any programs in Georgia. Georgia finances 100% of the programs itself.
1280,Poland is threatened by the European integration process. It may make Poland lose its sovereignty and become part of a supranational European state.
1281,In the last decades a considerable number of European countries have lost their sovereignty. Ideological dogmas of liberal political correctness serve as a cover for a new form of colonialism. In many European countries political elites follow the mentioned dogmas and totally lack a sense of responsibility about their respective countries and peoples.
1282,"According to many experts, from the very beginning, the Eastern Partnership programme was aimed at weakening Russia's geopolitical influence in Eastern Europe, as well as creating alternative energy supplies for Europe."
1283,"The EU was born in order to preserve the Atlanticist hegemony over Western Europe and, after the fall of the Berlin wall, over some countries of the former Warsaw Pact."
1284,"Ukrainian language law makes it almost impossible for the Russian-speaking population [in Ukraine] to use the Russian language.  This applies not only to the Russian language, but also to Hungarian and others [...] That is, the law deprives people of their fundamental rights and freedoms.  Moreover, the Constitution and the procedure of consideration were violated."
1285,"NATO is a relic from the old times. Currently, it is an obstacle for the establishment of a new global security system. By the very fact of its existence and its outdated formula to create an enemy, NATO causes threats on the international stage and hampers global peace. Such countries as Russia and China - especially Russia - have become NATO’s chosen enemies."
1286,"Europe has distanced itself from God. Europe has accepted an immoral, perverted way of life and declared the sin of sodomy as a norm."
1287,"Modern Europe distanced itself from God and accepted depravity, juvenile justice, and sectarianism, that is why Notre-Dame is burning. Today's Europe trampled down eternal ideals and declared that defending gay activists is more important than Christian morals."
1288,"Crimea detached from Ukraine by a popular referendum and was ithen ncorporated into Russia.
The authorities of Crimea and Sevastopol held a referendum on 16 March 2014 on reunification with Russia. As a result, 96.7 percent and 95.6 percent of citizens respectively voted in favour of joining the Russian Federation."
1289,"There was coup d’état in Ukraine in February 2014.

Political and economic relations between Russia and Western countries had deteriorated after the coup in Ukraine in 2014.

1299,"This year, two great churches of Paris were the object of fires. In the opinion of the most knowledgeable specialists, the Notre-Dame fire is a criminal arson because it could not come unexpectedly like that, on the beams which make a square meter of section and which are 700 years old. Try burning an oak log and you'll see what it takes.
It's probably the work of an intelligence service, because the equipment and the spread of the flame required organisation that probably goes beyond a personal initiative.
These fires must be a warning. For years, we have been denouncing the transfer of population from non-European countries to Europe, especially to France."

1302,"The legacy of Petro Poroshenko, who is approaching the end of his five-year presidential term, is marred by war, economic decline, and Russophobic policies.

A recent New York Times op-ed hails the ""reforms"" which the outgoing Ukrainian leader supposedly spearheaded -- the same reforms which left 13,000 people dead and caused the economy to shrink by 15% in two years.

Moreover, the works of 500 Russian writers have been banned in Ukraine. A further 1,000 Russian artists are prohibited from entering the country,"

1307,"Europe is defacing itself and its existence. It is not Europe of Peter and Paul, it is not Europe of big men and not Europe of big Roman bishops. Contemporary Europe in its anti-Christian spirit is more godless than communism. Communism inherited at least a little bit of Christian morality. Europe has neither that spirit, nor that morality and today it completely destroys Christianity and becomes an Islamic zone."
1308,Crimea has become a Russian region following the referendum of March 2014 in which 96.77% of the Republic’s population and 95.6% of Sevastopol inhabitants voted to become part of Russia. Crimean authorities organised the referendum after the coup d’état.

1318,"The West began generously paying Belarusian opposition for mixing politics and religion. This decision was made after failures to destabilize the country through social and political spheres. As a result, Belarusian opposition began a crusade against the Orthodox church from Kurapaty memorial site. Nobel prize winner in literature, Svetlana Aleksievich, a number of civic activists, opposition politicians and a member of parliament Anna Kanapackaya declared war against the Orthodox Church."
1319,"Opposition leader Mikalai Statkevich, a chairman of totalitarian Satanist sect Narodnaya Hramada (People's Assembly) proclaimed a crusade against the Orthodox church in Belarus. He is supported by the self-proclaimed Belarusian National Congress and a sectarian protestant community named in honour of John the Baptist. Svetlana Aleksievich, a Noble prize winner in literature, also called for a sectarian coup.
Leanid Akalovich of the Belarusian Authocephalous Orthodox Church is the political face of this group. His mission is to orchestrate the Ukrainian scenario in Belarus. Hence in the post-Soviet space, an open war of Authocephalous churches is unfolding against the Orthodox church, the former supported by the Belarusian opposition. And as long as the Western sponsors feed them, they will bark like dogs."
1320,"Lithuania plans to commemorate Polish revolutionary Wincenty Konstanty Kalinowski who it is claimed, without good reason, to be Belarusian. In their own interests, the West and Russophobia advocates have seemingly selected the little-known terrorist Kalinowski, as a Belarusian national hero, to promote terrorism. This encourages Belarusians willing to commit crime to obey orders from Western curators."

1325,"On 23 April 2019 Reuters introduced amendments into its article that was published a few days earlier. It initially stated that Venezuela bypasses US sanctions on oil exports thanks cooperation with the Russian oil company Rosneft. The amendments followed a very critical Rosneft reaction to Reuters' article. Nobody was surprised by this Rosneft-related defamatory publication because Reuters is regularly exposed on reporting fakes. In the last years even the most authoritative western media and political forces lost their respectability and reputation.

When it comes to Russian gas giant Gazprom, it has built on Soviet successes in the gas sector. The company is a well-known devil for the West. Rosneft is a different story because a series of big Russian successes in the oil sector is a recent phenomenon. A few years ago Moscow began taking control over the world oil market from the west. It hijacked OPEC from Washington by reaching an agreement with Saudi Arabia behind the US's back. Therefore Rosneft is manifestation of a new Russia, which is cunning, sneaky and developing tricky schemes with the so called 'pariah' states (Iran, Venezuela, Syria) to the detriment of Western economic and political interests.

Western hatred towards Rosneft translates into creation of an infernal image of Rosneft and blaming the company for any sins or crimes, and Reuters' publication perfectly fits into this trend."

1329,"Poroshenko's team was very active in promoting anti-Russian sanctions in Washington. It passed colossal Russia-related volumes of information on to the US Democratic party as part of these activities. The Democrats, however, mostly used this information against Trump rather than against Russia. Generally the information concerning Trump's connections with Moscow was exchanged for US anti-Russian sanctions to please Ukrainian authorities.

For the whole period of the Mueller commission's work, which is over two years, Trump could not do anything about it because media interpreted any his counteractions as an intention to hide his connections with Moscow. However, the official conclusion of the Mueller commission proves that Trump has not developed ties with Moscow. Hence it turned out that Clinton administration violated US laws based on the falsified documents passed by the Poroshenko team alleging illegal Trump ties with Russia."

1350,"At least 40 members of the White Helmets, the notorious Western group posing as volunteer rescue workers, admitted that they had taken part in the staging of chemical attacks in Syria, according to a new study conducted by the Foundation for the Study of Democracy and unveiled at the UN. The fake attacks were designed to lay the blame on -- and provoke armed retaliation against -- the Syrian government.

The study also casts considerable doubt on the accuracy of OPCW reports concerning the alleged chemical attack in Douma, noting that the fact-finding mission based its conclusions on ""falsified facts and untrustworthy or unidentified sources""."
1351,"All Ukrainian politicians are dependent on Washington because they save their money in Western bank accounts that Washington has influence on. Petro Poroshenko was an ideal Ukrainian presidential candidate for the US until his military provocation in the Kerch Strait. He was a guarantee for the US that Ukraine could not make any agreements with Vladimir Putin because the latter was not in position to negotiate with Poroshenko. However, on his anti-Russia path, Poroshenko tried so hard that he began leading the US to direct military confrontation with Russia. American politicians cannot afford to cross this red line and they will kill anyone who attempts to push them into war with Russia. Poroshenko's arranged military provocation in the Kerch Strait shaped his political future."

1353,"European circles consider that if Putin wins in Russia with such a [high] score, it is a threat to democracy, that it is an authoritarian regime, that there is a falsification in vote counting. But when a candidate wins with such a score in a country that matches the interests of the United States and Europe, everyone finds it normal. Macron has invented an explanation of style: do not compare, the system in your state is different. Everything is transparent. Everything is perfect. It's two weights, two measures."

This is not the first time that elements concerning special effects videos of chemical attacks in Syria appear. Thus, on February 13, the BBC's producer in charge of Syria, Riam Dalati, said that footage shot in a hospital after the April 7, 2018 chemical attack in Douma was staged."

Nowadays the majority of newborns in Brussels are from the new Islamic community. "
1372,"The Verkhovna Rada adopted the law “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language”, securing its exclusive rights in comparison with other languages in the country.  According to the document, the Ukrainian language is recognised as the only possible application in almost all areas of the country's life.

This is a discriminatory law that implies punitive measures.  If it comes into force, it will significantly affect the literacy of the population of Ukraine and greatly impoverish it culturally.

1373,"Russia provided passports to Donbas locals, because Kyiv deprived the region of social transfers and pensions, and furthermore denied local citizens their voting rights."
1374,"As Western NGOs have failed to draw Armenia away from its ties to Russia, religious organisations, representing the Global Government, have been employed.

In the Western undeclared war on Yerevan, Mormons are playing the role of intelligence agents, as they are capable of collecting information across Armenian territory freely. In turn, the Jehovah’s Witnesses perform the role of a military service that occupies entire cities and villages, while forming their new legions from local citizens. In essence, the purpose of these sects is to conduct subversive activities, to destroy the foundations of statehood under the pretext of promoting faith."
1375,"For the past five years, the Kiev-dominated Ukrainian state has been nothing but a puppet regime for Washington, NATO and to a lesser extent the European Union. It has served as a spearhead against Russia with vile provocations and slander. It is in fact an abomination of international law and democratic principles."
1376,"The law strengthening the use of the Ukrainian language adopted by Kyiv proves that Ukraine is following the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian scenarios, which means that disloyal parts of the population are excluded from public life based on their languages. The next step will be issuing passports for foreigners, as in the Baltic countries."
1377,The Ukrainian government practically deprived Donbas and Luhansk of voting rights. Ukraine is a colony of the US.

The West has launched a second wave of colour revolutions with wider geography. The goal is to create a zone of instability around Russia, China, and Germany, with a new chain of coups. An example of such actions is the series of Arab Spring in the Greater Middle East. The aim was to control oil production, to weaken Russia's traditional and China's growing influence over Arab countries. And to export processes to rival countries.



"
1383,"After the coup in Ukraine in 2014, a regime of terror was established. Given the radical political preferences of the Ukrainian population, Volodymyr Zelenskiy does not need to initiate any substantial changes. Hence, the system of governance by terrorism will continue in Ukraine."
1384,"Elections are a tool used to hide mistrust of political authorities and confidence in their own strength. Parliaments are corrupt, be it through the contributions by lobbyists or through the misguided belief that one can actually make a difference by voting in parliamentary elections. This self-deception is the cheapest corruption.

Elections to the European Parliament have been held since 1979. The Parliament's chief purpose has always been the stabilization of financial rule, the best example of which is the Euro-coup. If you cast a vote in the EU Parliament elections, you will never get it again."
1385,"In November 2018, Petro Poroshenko, who was clearly on the election campaign trail, tried to create a scandal to appeal again to the West and show how Russia is treating him and that new sanctions are needed.

The [Ukrainian] warships secretly tried to sneak through the Kerch Strait by entering [Russian] territorial waters, the part that was Russia's territorial waters before the referendum in Crimea."
1386,"The fire of Notre Dame was the work of the Luciferian New World Order (NWO) as an intended attack on Christiandom. The proof is the series of profanations and destruction of churches in Europe in the last years, 1.063 of them only in France in 2018: on average, 3 attacks per day. Nobody said these were accidents, but it is hardly a surprise that authorities claim now that the fire in Notre Dame was accidental because this is how the NWO operates. The Islamic State launched a campaign calling to attack in Easter; some witnesses affirmed to have heard explosions in the temple before it started burning; president Macron – a former employee of the Rothschilds - suspended an important speech intended to address the protests of the “yellow vests” that have been cornering his government for months; and fire fighting airplanes were not used despite the advice of US president Donald Trump.

It is impossible, in the era of technology, that a fire could break out by accident, and a large number of witnesses heard an explosion at the church as it started to burn. The firefighters did not use hydroplanes to put out the fire. President Macron, an employee of the Rotschilds, cancelled an important speech. And the day of the fire (April 15, 2019): 4+1+5+2+0+1+9 equals 22, a multiple of 11 - a number present in most mega-attacks. The timing coincides with the beginning of the Celtic month of the willows; the month of Witches, which culminates with the heathen Walpurgis Night on the 30 April - the eve of the foundation of the Illuminati Sect.

The fire of Notre Dame has an obvious parallel to 9/11, and not only because of the similarity between its architecture of two towers together, but also with the number 11, so important to occult symbolism. The destruction of the Twin Towers was the assault on an economic symbol, which was followed a few years later by a devastating economic crisis. It is not difficult to imagine what the attack on the Christian symbol of Notre Dame, the most famous cathedral in the world, means: an intensification of the persecution of Christianity that we are already suffering in the West.  The fire of Notre Dame is the 9/11 of Christianity.

The signs are obvious - this is work of the Satanic New World Order. We are at the gates of a total Armageddon. The New World Order will stage a new Catholic holocaust, which is overwhelmingly prophesied in countless stories - including the Protestant - on the final Apocalypse, where we will be judged."
1387,"Not many people were in the stadium, so the debates between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko evidently didn’t raise much interest among Ukrainian voters.

For almost 4 million people living in Kyiv, the debates did not attract interest, despite the extensive media hysteria."

1390,"Washington castrated the European Union at its birth by imposing a clause to be inserted in the Treaty of Maastricht – the ""suzerainty"" of NATO. The EU has a vassal status in relation to the United States. We should remember the total support offered by the European Union to all of the Pentagon’s adventures, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. In all these cases, without exception, the EU marched along its suzerain, NATO.

The European Union, which was imagined at a time when the world was divided into two irreconcilable blocs, is today completely unadapted. If they want to avoid being dragged by the United States into conflicts which are not their own, its members will have to free themselves from the European treaties and the integrated command of NATO."

There were already publications in which recent attacks on churches in France are listed. The question of whether these attacks are links of the same chain arises by itself.

It is already clear to many people that these acts are the work of the Islamic State. Destruction of others shrines is a common practice for Islamists. What to say here about France which continues to accept migrants from the Middle East and North Africa in thousands. Worse is coming."
1416,"As a result of its 2018 summit in Brussels, NATO has ceased to be a defensive alliance that contemplates the use of nuclear weapons only as an extreme measure. Instead it has become a “nuclear alliance” that no longer considers the use of nuclear weapons as an extreme measure. For this reason, NATO has become an obstacle to global security."
1417,"Churches in France began to burn after the new year and about a dozen have already burned down, many more have been desecrated. But the police spoke about the burning of temples by anarchists, not migrants, and there is a big difference there.

The Notre Dame fire was not an accident. In general, all these arsons and desecrations are the work of the special services. The mystery is only if it was done by the French or the American intelligence services.

Europe's weakness is well within the sphere of US interests. And so the burning of churches in France is quite a reason for new protests."

1433,"The final report by special counsel Robert Mueller cleared both Trump’s campaign team of collusion with the Kremlin and the president himself of obstruction of justice. It doesn’t provide evidence of Russian interference in the US elections in 2016. This proves how Russia is part of a campaign whereby it is always falsely accused of incidents, such as the poisoning of the Skripals, attempting to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, interfering in the European elections or even Brexit."
1434,"Russia bashing takes place in the French press. It has evolved a lot since the 70s and 80s when France’s media was pluralistic and discussions between different political figures took place. This is not the case nowadays. Take a random newspaper. Le Monde, for example: It is the Pravda of today. Its coverage of Russia is even worse than Pravda. Every media outlet reports the same. The question is, how has France reached this point?

In Russia, freedom of speech exists but in our own way.

In France, you can only say one thing about Russia, like aggression and that Putin is a dictator. This is freedom to say only one narrative. Let's take coverage of Ukraine in France. It's almost like one centre exists which indicates what to write: a democratic country is struggling against Russian aggression. Only a few media outlets mention that there are far right, Nazi forces in Ukraine which march like the Nazis in Germany in the 30s."

1437,"Russia fully respects the norms of international law. If there are some who feel offended, Russia has nothing to beg pardon for. Russia does everything that meets the norms of international law and the United Nations Charter. Russia respects the right of peoples to self-determination, including that of ethnic minorities, whether in Crimea or another regions. Sanctions will be ineffective in putting pressure on both Russia and other countries that respect their history and identity."

In case Zelenskiy attempts to distance himself from Kolomoyskiy, American total influence will continue, as they control the IMF which gives loans to Ukraine."

1457,The Ukrainian conflict was sparked by the USA in 2014.
1458,"The actions of the current leadership of Ukraine in the Donbas are criminal. For five years now the government of Petro Poroshenko has been leading a criminal war against its own citizens.  Despite the accusations of the Ukrainian authorities, Russia has nothing to do with the civil war in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukraine's accusations against Russia concerning Donbas are unfounded."
1459,"The U.S. Government is most willing to utilize “religion” for the propagation of its agenda. It is not at all anti-religious, it is, although, completely anti-christian [sic]. A new global mind and narrative must emerge. For this to happen the “old” mind must be eradicated – Christianity, specifically Orthodoxy.

So it is not surprising at all when tremors begin to emerge that Joe Biden and others in the US government are at current [sic] putting pressure on the Patriarch of Jerusalem to recognize the false and schismatic group in Ukraine. The schismatic group in Ukraine is but one example of the current global power’s willingness to utilize “religion/church” as a tool for its goals.

"
1462,"The cause of the fire in Notre Dame de Paris was Volodymyr Zelensky, said a psychic.


Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelensky visited Paris a few days ago to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron. He stopped just 5 km away from the cathedral. This is a warning sign from above for Macron, France and Ukraine that a such a fire might start around the world.

1463,"The fire in Notre Dame - ""revenge for insulting the Kaaba"", the holy shrine in Mekka. A mosque might be built at the site of Notre Dame."
1464,"Many Europeans would like to hear a comment from the Pope, but the Vatican keeps quiet. Internet users are warning that he eventually will deliver a speech on how Europe needs to be open and let in even more migrants and that a mosque should be build at the site of Notre Dame de Paris."
1465,"A scandalous video by German rock group Rammstein, contains a ""prediction"" of the fire in Notre Dame de Paris.
"
1466,"Accidental ignition during restoration works at Notre-Dame is still the main version of the ongoing investigation of the fire reasons.

But the fire at Notre-Dame began to storm too strongly and everywhere at the same time. This is not a gas station to flash from one spark. There wasn't enough wooden elements to be embraced by such a powerful fire. Many experts doubt that the cause of the fire was natural.

The second version: revenge against Macron from the left groups of Yellow vests. The fire started directly before Emmanuel Macron was supposed to address the nation and he was forced to postpone his speech. In France there are a lot of ultra leftists of all colours, from Trotskyists to anarchists, perhaps this was a planned blow against everything that they hate: religion, state, and Macron as the formal leader.

All this, of course, makes the  ""Islamist"" hypothesis much less probable. However, it occurred on the day of the beginning of the Holy Week in France. And there were already numerous cases when terrible events took place at this particular time. So, the ""message"" is evident."
1467,"Today Notre-Dame died. Of course, the reason of ""ignition"" will be identified later, but the real reason is already apparent. France became a country in which people smash the windows of boutiques just because they are expensive, where taxes are so high that successful people leave. This is connected through karma with the fact that the magnificent cathedral, which very clearly represented impudent luxury and demanded more work than 36-hour-week, was burned down intentionally.

What will be constructed on this place in a country where now statistically every 5th citizen is named Muhammad?"
1468,"The UK is planning to preserve its chemical labs, including the notorious Porton Down, to stage further provocations aimed against Russia, unjustly accused of using a nerve agent -- which the West calls novichok -- to poison two Russian nationals in Salisbury."

1473,"Who believes Macron's fake sorrow on the fate of Notre Dame? He is an atheist. European leaders have legalised gay marriages, they want to destroy Europe, just as they destroyed Serbia, Ukraine and attempted to destroy Russia. The Russians are the Christian Europe of today, a Europe of honour and faith, a Europe of knights, explorers and poets. This is us, Russia, the Russian World. We see how the heritage of a great civilisation is stolen from Europeans."
1474,"It is too early to rule out ""natural causes"" for the fire at Notre Dame of Paris, but it is possible that the cathedral was set ablaze either by the Yellow Vests as an attack on Macron, or by Islamist extremists. Even if the Islamist are not responsible for the fire, the very fact that some young supporters of radical Islam has expressed joy about this event is horrible. The fire from Notre Dame will set all of Europe on fire."
1475,"On the 4th of March 2018 in Salisbury, former GRU agent Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned, causing a major international scandal. The British authorities have accused the Russian state of being involved in the  poisoning. After one year the Skripal case crumbles due to the lack of proof to indicate Russia’s guilt."
1476,"France has been hit with a string of fires at Catholic churches, some of which occurred alongside acts of vandalism.

Paris’ second largest church, Saint-Sulpice, burst into flames on March 17, the fire damaging doors and stained glass windows. Police later reported that the incident had not been accidental. The story of Saint-Sulpice does not appear to be updated almost a month later suggesting that a deliberate attack of one of Paris' largest churches was not that newsworthy. 

The images of flames of Saint-Sulpice church are one example of the violence committed against Catholics. Also at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, statues and crosses were smashed and an altar cloth was burned in February.

Don't jump to conclusions before the facts come out, but keep in mind that churches have been burned across France for the last few months.

Anti-Christian attacks have sharply risen in France since the beginning of 2019.

It's unclear who is carrying out those attacks or why they did take place. But the real concern is why the French government and media generally underplay them. The true scale is still unknown.

1479,Ukraine will remain an anti-Russian ram for the US regardless who of the two presidential candidates will win. Washington will demand a continuation of anti-Russian policies by Kyiv. Ukraine has come back to the state of ruin and risks turning into wild field in the medium term. Sooner or later Russia will have to re-colonise Ukraine to rid it from western influences.
1480,"The fire at the Notre Dame occurs at a very suitable moment for a France, torn into pieces by protests and even more for France's government. It is still unknown what will be uncovered by the investigation. But unfortunately, in the modern world, one can really believe in coincidences."
1481,"Ukrainian army military actions against the population of South-Eastern Ukraine started in April 2014. Neither of the two presidential candidates will likely resolve the Donbas conflict. The anti-terrorist operation in Eastern Ukraine has turned into the symbol of Ukraine's existence. In this light, peace in Donbas can only be guaranteed by an alien accidentally elected as a president."

It is unlikely that these Russian defendants will ever show up in an American courtroom. Therefore, no alleged evidence on which these allegations are based will be subject to adversarial review. This is essential, especially in the cyberworld, as leaked internal CIA documents have revealed that intelligence agencies can usurp the origin of an attack to give the impression that it came from a different country than the one who actually perpetrated it."
1487,"USSR and Warsaw Pact no longer exist but NATO not only exists but is developing as well. NATO enlargement and development of its infrastructure near Russian borders is one of the potential threats to Russia's national security. Russia has done everything to cooperate with NATO in order to deal with real problems such as international terrorism, local military conflicts, uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction. But Russia-NATO cooperation was actually cut."
1488,"The latest major provocation organised by Kiev took place on November 25, when three ships of the Ukrainian Navy violated the Russian border near the Kerch Strait. They were conducting dangerous manoeuvrers and refusing to obey orders from the Coast Guard before attempting illegal actions in Russian territorial waters. The Russian coastguard then used weapons to stop them. Russian authorities arrested 24 Ukrainian soldiers, including two members of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU). These agents were on board the ships to coordinate the provocation.

Russia condemns the intense activity of NATO in the Black Sea and will take appropriate and adequate measures to neutralise the dangers resulting from a growing NATO activity."
1489,"The NATO is increasing its activities in the Black Sea [reconnaissance flights and presence of military vessels] because the US wishes to provoke an incident between NATO and Russia, similar to the provocation that took place in Kerch. The US wants to provoke a violent Russian response in order to block rapprochement between Russia and Turkey and to undermine the Turkish stream natural gas pipeline project."

1495,"Poroshenko understands he has no chance of winning the elections. That is why he is organizing total falsifications of the elections, with support of the EU and US.

Anti-family strategy is part of the war for Big Russia resources."
1497,"Warsaw has refused Russian offers to take part in the renovation of a World War II museum in Sobibor, under way since 2014. Three separate requests -- all made by private Russian institutions -- were rejected on spurious grounds and obviously for political reasons.

By doing so, Poland is trying to rewrite history and deny Russia's role in the liberation of Poland in general, and in the history of the Sobibor camp in particular. After all, it was a Red Army officer, Aleksandr Pechersky, who organized the 1943 Sobibor uprising, one of the few successful ones in the history of the Holocaust.

Vladimir Putin was not invited to the 70th anniversary event commemorating the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, held in Poland in 2015."
1498,"As opposition leader Juan Guaido is preparing a US-sponsored coup in Venezuela, pro-government activists in the country are bracing for possible military intervention.

The activists -- or colectivos -- are demonised by the mainstream media and portrayed in the West as government-sanctioned thugs who harass the opposition with impunity. In reality, these collective-action groups help alleviate poverty in working class areas of Caracas, and have served as volunteer organizers in national elections.

If they do take up arms, it will be to defend Venezuela from potential armed intervention by the United States."
1499,"The United States are planning to foment unrest and secessionism to force the territorial division of Venezuela in order to gain access to its natural resources. There are several areas as potential focus for an artificially-fuelled separatism: the Paraguaná peninsula (rich in hydrocarbons), the so-called ‘Western half-moon’ composed by the states of Zulia, Táchira and Mérida (rich in hydrocarbons, agrarian and farming products), the ‘Western triangle’ of the cities of Barquisimeto, Acarigua and Valencia (strategically decisive) and the region of Guayana (rich in minerals)."
1500,"Each opposition organisation, civic activists and independent media outlets in Belarus prepare kill lists, which contain information (first and last names, names of the relatives, passwords, photos, etc.) about high-ranking state officials, policemen and employees of other law-enforcement agencies, entrepreneurs, etc.  For instance, civic activists can take photos of Belarusian policemen in plain clothes at public events such as the celebration of the 101st anniversary of the Belarusian People's Republic. These lists are likely aggregated into one database, controlled by Western security bodes.

In case of a peaceful power change in Belarus the persons in the kill lists will be subject to lustration. Law-enforcement agencies like the Ministry of Interior, the KGB and the Investigation Committee will be dissolved. The restoration of the law-enforcement apparatus will take place on the orders of Western donors. In case the power change in Belarus is not peaceful, then those on the kill lists and their relatives will be declared the enemies of the people and executed whereas their kids will  be labeled the dregs of society."
1501,"In the Moscow region, an activist with the surname Pirozhok of the extremist Ukrainian organisation ""Praviy Sektor"" was arrested for being sent to Russia for propaganda and recruitment purposes."
1502,"The Spanish government used all the resources of the State to crush the left-wing party Podemos and the main media happily contributed to it spreading false information against it. And now that this state-sponsored smear campaign has been uncovered, those same media prefer to ignore it. Spain is the worst place in the world to learn about this scandal."
1503,"The European Union increases spending on events that will become an instrument of influence on the internal affairs of third-party countries.  In 2020, the EU intends to allocate about 1,500,000 euros to create a mechanism of influence on other states and to create a network of European agents in other countries. This will be a new tool for the colonisation of other states."

1507,"The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, who were always professional, used to arrive back when Saakashvili was president and voice their concerns, although it was obvious that they first and foremost placed emphasis on statements which were in the authorities’ interests. This continued after the Georgian Dream came to power... This Commission shuns conclusions or acutely critical assessments that would go against any incumbent authorities’ grain."
1508,"The signing in September 2014 of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the EU has not benefited Georgia, which remains reliant on the post-Soviet market for its exports. Exports to the DCFTA countries have not increased."

1510,"Poland should not adopt euro. It will follow the destiny of the Southern European countries. The de-industrialisation processes hit the Southern European countries as soon as they adopted euro. They lost their competitiveness to Germany. Italy, once a powerful industrial country, lost its power."
1511,"The economic problems in Europe are gradually more noticeable. 20 years after the adoption of euro not all the European counties benefited from the common currency and Italy has been affected in the most negative way. Before the adoption of euro Italy did not have 5 million people below the poverty line, companies were not shut down and the young people did not have to move abroad. The responsibility for that lies on the European Union."
1512,NATO bombed Yugoslavia 20 years ago because it wanted to gain a foothold in the Balkans. It wanted the Bondsteel military base.
1513,"The US government and its armed forces are the symbols of international military and economic terrorism.

It is the US government that should be held accountable as the founder and supporter of terrorist groups."
1514,"More than half of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the Donbas who left the combat zone in 2014 still cannot find work on the territory controlled by the government of Ukraine. The reason for this is the low level of wages and the catastrophic shortage of jobs for Ukrainians. In addition, internally displaced persons cannot find housing, and therefore return to the occupied territories."
1515,Ukrainian elections are very competitive – but it is a competition of falsification and extortion. The elections are not very fair.
1516,"Belarusian nationalists promote Polish and Lithuanian agendas and manipulate society by saying that national idea is absent in Belarus. The Belarusian society bought this manipulation and even president Alyaksandr Lukashenka publicly stated that the national idea has to be formulated for the country. In fact, this a false message because the actual national idea has always been present and its essence is that Belarusians are Russians. Minor differences that Belarusians have are the result of Polish and Baltic influences."

The border service staff in the North-East of Poland uncovered 180 foreigners, mostly citizens of Ukraine, who worked illegally.

1524,The United States is fed up with imposing sanctions on Russia. Any new sanctions will hit the economy of the United States more than the Russian economy. Sanctions do not work. The United States sees this and understands it.
1525,"NATO is trying to aggravate the situation in the Black Sea region: ships from the Netherlands, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have entered Georgian and Ukrainian ports. The manoeuvrers of the ships of the North Atlantic Alliance exacerbate the situation in the region. NATO specifically provokes Russia: the Alliance takes advantage of any country that is located next to Russia. "

1527,"The biggest producers of fake news for the area of the world are the French, US, British, Belgian, etc. governments. and the media that works with it. So it's a weird thing to see this witch hunt.

Calling competitors “fake news media” is a way of establishing a monopoly of information and to control. So, the public should not be impressed when the word fake news is used."
1528,"At its 70 years, NATO implements the same tasks as it's been originally planned: restraining Russia, ensuring US hegemony in the European security system and preventing the creation of a hard security system in Western Europe that would be independent.

The main purpose of NATO's existence is a new cold war, which started in 2014."
1529,"NATO is the only organization that has unleashed all wars on the planet in the last 25 years. The organisation, which was intended to defend Europe, conducted its first military operation against Europe (in Bosnia, 1994).

NATO is a cynical and aggressive organization, a tool of the United States to establish dictatorship on the planet."
1530,"Volodymyr Zelensky's presidential bid is an “attempt” of French President Emmanuel Macron to “brainwash” Ukrainians and obscure real situation there. 
"
1531,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has become a huge money making machine. Over the past 15 years, NATO has pumped 5 billion euros from Latvia.


NATO members are seen as colonizers and occupiers in the countries where they pretended to install democracy. "
1532,"
For the anniversary of NATO the foreign ministers of the member countries met. In the program of festivities, the enemy of always: Russia of course. NATO is again brandishing the so-called Russian threat, this time in the Black Sea in order to further militarise this region of the world.


Moscow does not welcome NATO's willingness to increase its presence on the ground and, above all, does not see the point to such actions. NATO refers to the 2018 incident in which three Ukrainian military ships were arrested by the Russian authorities in the Strait of Kerch. Moscow then denounced a provocation. This is a violation of key provisions of international law, including of the UN Charter which impose respect of the sovereignty of other states. Military surveillance, chartering ships, all this is very expensive. 

The financial contribution of the European member states of NATO is not up to Donald Trump's expectations. It is precisely by creating these kinds of Russian threats that Washington hopes it will get its allies to invest more money.

1533,"Western diplomats attempted to impact the results of the presidential election in Ukraine. The French, US, Spanish and some other diplomats were accused of the interference into the election process."
1534,"The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv lost control of Crimea and Donbas after the coup in 2014, which prompted the people of Crimea to demand the restoration of Russian identity and return in the arms of Russia while the people of the Donbas region pushed to declare independence from Kyiv by establishing two popular republics in the region."
1535,"The problems with Schengen visas for nationals of Belarus stem from smear reports by the Belarusian opposition to the EU about banned gay prides in Minsk. EU politicians do not want to let Belarusians in, nor lower the visa fees, because the rights of sexual minorities are violated and because the number of gays per capita in Belarus is too low. The EU is also concerned with gender inequality in Belarus. A woman is not welcome in the EU if she has no balls. This is what the EU's policy towards Belarus is based on. Since the Belarusian opposition does not mention a couple of thousand of Belarusians gays in its quarterly reports to the EU, no better EU's attitude towards Belarus can be expected in the near future."
1536,"After demonstrations number 19 and 20 of the Yellow Vests, protesters claimed to have been hit more violently than with the tear gas usually used by the police. Its chemical compound has created controversy, some relaying on Twitter the results of medical tests that demonstrate cyanide poisoning."
1537,"The State Duma recalled that over the past five years, under the leadership of Petro Poroshenko, Kyiv has not advanced in the way of Europe, but only moved away from Moscow.

&nbsp;"
1538,"On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the founding of NATO, the Alliance Defence College presented three ways to develop the military bloc. The report includes the “good”, “bad” and “terrible” scenarios, and in each of the forecasts, Russia is considered an enemy."
1539,"The Polish Orthodox Church has confirmed that it does not recognise the autocephaly of the ""new church"" in Ukraine, the office of the Council of Bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church said."
1540,"At the time of German reunification, NATO promised Gorbachev that it would not expand to the East in the case the USSR gave up the Warsaw Pact and allowed the fall of Berlin wall."
1541,"Poroshenko is about to stage a serious provocation as he has no other way to win the elections. Germany refused to participate in provocations in the Black Sea, while Canada agreed and sent its ships."
1542,"Nowadays, no country, not even the European Union invests in Ukraine. Without investments, it will be very difficult to revive the Ukrainian economy."
1543,"Georgia intends to join the NATO, after which it will become a military protectorate of the United States."
1544,"The Belarusian opposition is planning a revolution, pro-Western forces stand behind the protests. The Belarusian authorities have to act decisively, and they should have done this immediately after protests against the Union State between Belarus and Russia started. In contrast to the opposition's will, the integration process with Russia should be accelerated. Belarus should also adopt Russian experience on combatting nationalists. If all these measures are taken, then the Belarusian presidential elections will be smooth, without involving armed Ukrainian nationalists. Belarus should also not allow the opposition to organise mass demonstrations, otherwise it will attract the attention of the international community and provoke a conflict. Finally, the Belarusian authorities should not play with those Europeans who support the Belarusian opposition. The blogger NEXTA, Andrei Sannikau and other opposition activists should be extradited to Belarus and recognised as enemies of the people."
1545,"With the war against Yugoslavia 20 years ago, which was contrary to international law, NATO made the world a theatre of war."
1546,"To cover up their anti-state activities, Belarusian opposition uses Ukrainian nationalists with weapons. In 2017 the team of the Belarusian opposition politician Mikalai Statkevich attempted to carry out a terrorist act during the mass protest action in Belarus. The US State Department did not mention this case in its Belarus human rights report because just as the Belarusian opposition, the US is interested in the destabilisation of situation in Belarus."
1547,"Hundreds of angry farmers protested in Warsaw, demanding that the anti-Russian sanctions be lifted, as they put farmers on the brink of a ruin."
1548,"Russia does not occupy Ukrainian territory. The words 'occupation' or 'annexation' are completely inapplicable to the Crimea - neither de facto nor de jure.

The self-proclaimed people's republics of Luhansk and Donetsk were repelled by Kyiv and everything that happens in the region is a consequence of the policies of Ukraine's current leadership."
1549,"Ukrainian administration, the secret service and the military are under US control.

EU's interference in Ukraine always comes across well as ""support"", while Russia is called to respect Ukraine's sovereignty."
1550,Both Poroshenko and Zelensky are puppets of Western imperialism and enemies of Ukrainian people.
1551,"The Western community is concerned that the war in Ukraine could end after the Ukrainian presidential elections.

One of the myths of German foreign policy is the idea that Chancellor Angela Merkel is striving for peace in the Ukrainian conflict."
1552,"Maia Sandu was indebted to Filat, that is why Sandu government asked for the early release of ex prime minister of Moldova.

1556,"Poland and Hungary are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the rule from Brussels. In view of this and the looming prospect of the UK's exit from the EU,  other member states could follow suit and accelerate the bloc's disintegration."
1557,"NATO was built upon a set of lies, such as an alleged expansion of Soviet communism. This was never true. As NATO expanded in the Eastern Europe, despite promises given to Moscow, Russia found out that it was in an existential danger. Any systematic concession to Western powers would mean the disappearance of Russia as a united state, the deprivation of its natural resources, not to say the destruction of its own population. Now NATO is focusing on its expansion in Latin America since the block needs the support of other governments in other continents to expand its networks and influences."
1558,"Russians are the new Jews, the persecuted nation. Globally Russians are discriminated because of their nationality."
1559,"The Kurapaty memorial site on the outskirts of Minsk has become a Western project to ruin Belarusian statehood. Regular prayers by the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Kurapaty are a proof of this. The prayers are conducted for political reasons, to blame the Belarusian authorities for their incapacity, to provoke revolutionary moods among the population and to, eventually, destabilise the country."
1560,"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster. Following its break-up, the so called independent post-Soviet states emerged. They are only nominally independent as, in fact, they are rather feudal principalities governed by the West. The integration of a post-Soviet space is a necessary precondition to get rid of external Western governance and to restore genuine independence and statehood."

1564,"Western countries control a network of Belarusian NGOs which threaten the Belarusian state and society. In the coming years, the West will direct its efforts to destroy the historic conscience of Belarusian society, to create a negative image of Russia and misconceptions of Russia-Belarus relations among Belarusians, to spark nationalism and to discredit important state and societal institutions including the President, army, law-enforcement agencies and Orthodox church.

These activities are already underway; however the development of information technologies makes them cheaper and gives them a new dimension."
1565,"Unless the alliance keeps expanding, it will lose relevance and become just another international institution that produces purely declarative products."
1566,"Climate activists don't appreciate the progress their parents and grandparents have made with sweat on their faces. They don't realise that they are so well off right now, not because of their own diligence, but because of this legacy, which they want to destroy in the name of green faith. Ecologism, not ecology!

It is precisely thanks to previous generations that university occupiers and fans of the terrifying Greta can travel easily, enjoy technological progress, and democracy as well.

1567,"During his visit to Georgia in late March, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that Georgia should pay 2% of its GDP for defence and NATO will fulfill this purpose for Georgia. Effectively, Georgia should pay money to NATO without being a member and without being afforded protection under Article 5 protection."
1568,"NATO controls the military infrastructure of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, without including these countries into the NATO block. Thus the Russian Federation is partially surrounded by NATO."
1569,The Anaklia seaport project in Georgia is a NATO and US effort to regain a foothold in the Black Sea because they have no presence in the region.
1570,"If Belarus does not deepen integration with Russia within the Treaty on Union State, it will follow the Ukrainian path and will turn into anti-Russia. All events in Belarus are currently developing the same way as in Ukraine a few years ago."

1574,"The United States is allocating financial assistance only for Georgia’s military and defence needs, ignoring non-military assistance altogether."
1575,"NATO continues to cultivate old ways of thinking and the image of Russia as an enemy.

One of the main objectives of the Western military alliance is still the ""fight against the aggression of Moscow"".

Moscow keeps calling for an end to Cold War block thinking.  But that would mean the alliance having to search for a new meaning and new goals. For NATO it is easier to live with the good old enemy image."
1576,"Those here who behave aggressively [towards Russia] are driven by American culture.

American culture holds that Russia is ""bad"" simply because it is Russia."

1581,"Dmitri Alperovitch, one of the founders of the US-based cybersecurity company Crowdstrike and a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, is effectively the only source for the American media on Russian hackers and the hybrid war the Kremlin is waging against the world."
1582,"The Ukrainian authorities were involved in the catastrophe of the Malaysian Boing over Donbas on 17 July 2014.

The Boeing catastrophe has connections to the Ukrainian side, this is confirmed by various facts. There is no doubt the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and his press agency knew about the catastrophe beforehand. Other Kyiv officials have also been connected to the case."
1583,"The Kerch incident was used by President Petro Poroshenko to cancel the election in Ukraine, because he understood that it is difficult for him to win."
1584,"The US Ambassador to Kyiv controls Ukraine. The Ukrainian government will do nothing until receiving instructions from the US Ambassador. Therefore, there are no complaints about fraud in the presidential elections in Ukraine."
1585,"The 2019 presidential election in Ukraine is unique for several reasons. First, it takes place amid a civil war. Second, notwithstanding the civil war, the electoral campaign is very competitive. The competition does not concern politicians or their electoral programmes but is centred around a degree of false statements by candidates. There was hardly a case before whereby the Central Electoral Commission's -system presented data on 50% of processed ballots by 9am the day following the election."
1586,"Approximately 3 million people couldn’t vote in the Donbas region, neither could Ukrainians living and working in Russia since the Ukrainian Embassy didn’t open the planned voting stations. Moscow thinks that 7 to 10 million of Ukrainian citizens didn’t have the chance to participate in the electoral process. “This problem had an enormous influence in yesterday’s elections”, said the president of the observation mission from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Michal Szczerba during a press conference on April 1st."
1587,"There is no big difference for the US regarding who will be Ukraine's next president because, in any case, American geopolitical interests in Ukraine are strongly protected for the near future. If Volodymyr Zelensky becomes the next President, pressure on the Russian language in Ukraine will likely soften, whereas the powers of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory over Ukrainian history and culture are likely be diminished.

On foreign policy, under Zelensky's presidency, Ukraine will continue Euro-Atlantic integration. The country's external debts to IMF and the World Bank will keep growing and relations with Russia will remain confrontational. As for the resolution of the Donbas conflict or Crimea’s status, these issues are decided in Washington rather than in Kyiv. The US is interested in unleashing anti-Russia hysteria in Central Europe and in containing Russia via an escalation in Russia-Ukraine relations."
1588,"No reasonable person can claim today that the US has any concern for human rights. Except for Israel, the US has by far the worst record of human rights violations during the past several hundred years, far outstripping anything attributed to people like Stalin or Hitler, or even the Japanese."
1589,"The OSCE representative wants to make a stinking garbage out of the Belarusian segment of internet, and to turn it into a place full of extremists, terrorists and anarchists.

The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Harlem Désir, paid a three-day visit to Belarus. The visit's aim was to demonstrate how bad the things are with Belarus' media sphere.  Désir called on Belarusian authorities to reconsider existing measures that tighten state control of the internet. He urged to refrain from mandatory authentication of users posting online and praised the users’ right for anonymity.

1595,"Vilnius has started court proceedings against the soviet soldiers, who in 1991 were trying to disperse the crowds that were attacking the TV tower. The charges are trumped up.

The experts have determined that people died from sniper-fire and hunting rifles, but the soviet soldiers had no equipment like that. To this day it is not clear who fired the shots upon the protesting crowd. There was a third party involved. Lithuanians fired on their own people. It was the first example of a colour revolution."
1596,"The presidential elections in Ukraine have rightly been described as a race between three neo-Nazis, each more of a Russia-hating racist than the rest.

Whichever one of them wins, the United States and the entire NATO alliance are mortally committed to supporting an extremist, out-of-control and desperate failing regime that would not hesitate to pull America into a thermonuclear war for its own selfish ends."
1597,In the next 20 days Poroshenko will organise new provocations in Donbas - ahead of the second round of Ukrainian presidential election.
1598,For the past 5 years Ukraine has been the American project. From the American point of view Ukraine is a Western part of Russia. The US wants to drag Russia to the Western vector of geopolitics through Ukraine.
1599,"Russian Deputy Prosecutor-General Nikolai Vinichenko stated that the Russian side provided all Russian radar data to the Netherlands, with documents indicating that the BUK missile system that hit the (Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777) was Ukrainian, but this information was ignored by investigators.

1600,"America is entirely staging the Presidential elections in Ukraine.

Americans have worked out a system, where they take a popular person and create their [political] image. The situation with the comedian has been played out many times  - in Guatemala, in Haiti.

1601,"In the second round of Presidential elections Poroshenko will organise even more falsifications, than in the first round. He has no other choice. That is why the Russian Parliament will suggest not recognizing the elections."
1602,Ukrainians voted in Presidential elections at gunpoint and accompanied by special forces. The Ukrainian government brought armoured vehicles and armed security officials to the streets in order to morally influence Ukrainians during the elections. Ukrainians themselves regarded this as an attempt to intimidate disloyal citizens and to demonstrate the readiness of the regime of Petro Poroshenko to intervene in the elections with force.

1605,"The crash of the MH17 passenger craft was caused by Ukraine's failure to close its airspace over the rebel held areas of the Donbas.

Ukraine is, thus, the main party responsible for the tragedy."
1606,"The authorities in Kyiv is refusing the residents of Donbas the right to vote in Ukraine’s presidential elections. Ukraine did not give a vote to residents of the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine. In the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, not a single polling station was opened.
"
1607,"Five years after the annexation of Crimea to Russia it seems that another region of Ukraine has a discord with the central government: Transcarpathia.
Tensions between Kiev and Budapest on the Transcarpathia issue began several months ago.The minority of Trascarpatia is struggling for its right to education in the Hungarian language.

Like Russian speakers in the East of Ukraine, Hungarian speakers rose up against this law adopted in September 2018. In the past, Ukraine did not hesitate to shoot at its own people. In Donbass, since 2014, the inhabitants of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk die. But why are they attacking Hungary which is part of NATO and the EU?


If Ukraine goes on like this, they will end up offending Viktor Orban for real. Russian parlamentarians promised to evaluate the situation as the EU institutions will not.
"
1608,"10 million voters were not allowed to vote in the presidential elections in Ukraine. Observers from Russia were not allowed to this election. In addition, polling stations in Russia and Donbas were not open. This made it impossible for up to 10 million voters to take part in elections

1612,"Since 1990, the Western answer was clear: under no circumstances should Moscow be able to sit at the same table.  The new antagonism was decreed by the West and they tried to bring it about by global constriction of the Russian Federation.

The warlike provocations of the West in the Black Sea must cease and there must be the opportunity for all sides to face up to their true behaviour.  The escalation screw is in American hands.  Europe and the world must be made capable of peace."
1613,"The intelligence services of France and Belgium are preparing a false-flag chemical attack in Syria's Idlib province, in coordination with local terrorist cells and the pseudo-humanitarian White Helmets group.

1619,"The Belarusian opposition is secretly managed by Western institutions, politicians and West-linked NGOs (funded by USAID). Their strategic aim is to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.

US, Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries are most active in this regard.

Over the last years, the West has been using Ukraine to pressure Belarus more often than before. Ukraine's role within the broader Western strategy against Belarus is to organise information provocations, to give military training to Belarusian radicals, to support public protests with arms, and to organize breakthroughs to Belarus by groups of Ukrainian militants."
1620,"Zionist Jews have distorted American politics since the time of President Harry S. Truman. President after president has backed down versus Israel when confronted by Jewish power. [...] Jews are essentially able to shut down any discussion of Palestine or of Palestinian rights. Given the extreme over-representation of Jews in both the news generation process and in various choke points in the political process, an honest discussion of Israel-Palestine and the actual U.S. interests in the region is extremely difficult to find anywhere in the mainstream media. [...]

Beyond all that, if one doubts the power of the Jewish/Israel lobby internationally, note one of the first actions undertaken by the new coup government in Bolivia. It has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with Israel as a top priority. Brazil also sought a closer relationship with Israel after conservative Jair Bolsonaro was elected president and pledged to visit the Jewish state, a promise which he carried out in March. Everyone in the world understands that the way to gain favor with Washington is to go through Israel."
1621,"After the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Belarus was next on the list for Western ""democratisation"". However, the West did not dare to apply this scenario against Belarus because of the latter's military alliance with Russia, a nuclear state. Instead the West decided to undermine Belarusian statehood by financing the opposition. During 25 years of Lukashenko ruling the West undertook at least seven attempts to organize revolution in Belarus. Mass protests after the 2006 presidential election in Belarus were managed from Vilnius and sponsored by the American CIA through Lithuanian State Security Department."
1622,"During the Ukrainian presidential elections, electoral fraud is inevitable, because planned networks and various pyramids, voter fraud, purchase of votes by various foundations, funds and so on, have already been worked out.

The Ukrainian government always has the most opportunities for election fraud."
1623,"The United States has deliberately banned travel to Crimea in order to avert the recognition of the peninsula's reunification with Russia. The move is the latest show of double standards present in US diplomacy, particularly in light of Washington's recent recognition of the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory.

Crimea rejoined Russia following a March 2014 referendum, conducted in accordance with international law and democratic standards. The US and other countries have refused to recognise the legitimacy of the vote."
1624,The members of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine are Petro Poroshenko’s people; personally fed and charged to realise his plan to remain for a second term.  Virtually all district election commissions are manned by Petro Poroshenko; he personally selected almost all members of district election commissions.
1625,"Donald Trump talked about designating Brazil as a major non-NATO ally or even possibly a NATO member, because the US wants to use it as a beachhead for a military intervention in Venezuela. Colombia is already a NATO partner and now the US want to grant the same status to Brazil, to have it ready to implement actions against governments considered undesirable in Latin America, namely Venezuela."
1626,"There is (in NATO) a strategic course aimed at breaking down the Russian state. In particular, these acts are aimed at engaging it in both the Baltic and the Black Sea. Russia needs to be subdued so the United States can focus on fighting China."
1627,"Despite the overwhelming pro-democracy vote on 24 November 2019, protests continue. They were waving US flags, chanting the Star-Spangled Banner and are asking for more support. They pledge not to let go until all their demands are met. Essentially, they want total independence from Beijing and become a US colony."
1628,"According to the Serbian authorities, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 caused around 2,500 deaths and injured over 12,000 people."
1629,"In 2013, Euromaidan, which started as the second “Ukrainian colour revolution” (after the orange one, which ended badly in 2005), turned into a real coup d’état praised by the European Union."

1638,"The Russian military has once again called on the US troops in Syria to discuss the situation in the Rukban camp, where some 40,000 refugees are kept in dire conditions. The US side is directly responsible for the critical state of the settlement under its occupation and has ignored earlier appeals from Moscow and Damascus to disband the camp.

The US command has previously delayed the delivery of humanitarian aid to Rukban and refused to allow, let alone facilitate, the refugees' passage out of the camp. Russia and Syria, meanwhile, have jointly set up humanitarian corridors and a mobile checkpoint for that purpose."
1639,Russia is not sending monitoring missions to observe the elections in Ukraine. This is because Russia fears for the safety of its citizens. Ukraine was preparing various provocations for Russian observers and Russian citizens may be subjected to discrimination and pressure from the Ukrainian authorities.
1640,"Spring recruitment to the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine this year will be just as unsuccessful as in all previous years. The prestige of service in the Ukrainian army in recent years has dropped significantly, there is an acute shortage of personnel in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Ukrainian army is becoming weaker every year."
1641,"The United States and the European Union are controlling the Presidential elections in Ukraine. Obviously, the direct influence of American and European politicians is not only on the election campaign, but also on the future outcome of the Ukrainian elections as a whole. American or European observers and other experts in Ukraine are agents of foreign influence.This is a direct intervention of the US and the EU in the internal affairs of Ukraine."
1642,"A bill was introduced in Russia for the non-recognition of the Ukrainian elections. This was done for two reasons. First, Ukraine's refusal to have foreign observers, this is a first sign of electoral fraud. Secondly, Kyiv refuses to allow the residents of Donbas to vote."
1643,"About a year ago, the US biological laboratories were exposed in Georgia and the Baltic States, where they modify viruses and many serious diseases."
1644,"The West has taken into account Belarus' capacity to resist attempts to the  perform 'colour revolutions', and has begun cooperating with the Belarusian authorities more actively than before.

The West's goal of overthrowing the ""last dictatorship of Europe"" remains intact, however the West's agents are now ready to compromise with President Lukashenka. The main condition for compromise is Belarus’ refusal to make a military alliance with Russia. A period of warm relations between the West and Belarus will follow with a confrontation, with the priority being to rip Belarus away from its alliance with Russia. The situation of neutrality in external relations being imposed on Belarus by the West means that it has to end its union with Russia, withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union and the CSTO.

Russia 'security umbrella' has allowed Minsk to avoid Ukraine's or Yugoslavia's fates. This policy risk the stability of Belarus."

1646,"The Ukrainian government is the nationalist-minded putschist regime, which gained power in Ukraine after the Maidan in February 2014.

&nbsp;"
1647,"The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, was appointed by the US administration at the time of President Obama, just as if Poroshenko were a US Ambassador to Ukraine. Hence, there is a bit of a clash over Ukraine between the Trump supporters and the State Department ones. The latter favour Poroshenko, while Trump doesn’t seem to care."
1648,"A new scandalous poisoning case is doing the rounds in the European press, this time of Imane Fadil, a Moroccan model who was allegedly a regular guest at former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's parties. The Litvinenko and Skripal cases are dragged up, thus alleging Russian involvement.  Any big case has to have Russia involvement. However, both cases were not even brought to court. There is no motive for either Berlusconi or the Russian security bodies to kill Fadil. The media are not interested in the lack of a good motive just as in the Skripal case."
1649,"On Monday 25 March, a new electrical blackout happened in several states of Venezuela. The cause of a power outage is supposed to be a cyber-attack. This is one of the first cyber-attacks of such a scale. All indications are that the attack was conducted from the United States."
1650,"An unenviable situation is developing in Latvia before the elections: people are being given the message that it is necessary to vote, otherwise, if you keep silent, ""Nazis will come"". People should stay at home and not vote. They don't need to be frightened that fascists will get into power, they are already in power."
1651,"The aggression that Russia is supposed to have waged against Ukraine in 2014 is a myth.

&nbsp;"
1652,"Europe fences itself off from Russia with a wall of fascism. It tries to isolate itself with the help of hate and Russophobia. This is much more efficient ""than stone walls"". Despite the annual marches of neo-Nazis, the European Union does nothing to condemn them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;"
1653,"


The European Union suffers more from its own sanctions than Russia. Cancelling the sanctions would demonstrate that Europeans are capable of resisting the pressure from the United States.

From the EU's point of view, it is extremely odd to impose sanctions that affect European companies more than Russian companies.

"
1655,"The Ukrainian side is involved in the catastrophe of the shooting down of MH17 over the Donbas.

The plane crash was followed by a phenomenally rapid reaction by the Ukrainian government. It is clear that President Poroshenko and his press service were informed in advance. The fact that the airspace over the war zone had not been closed is also an indication. Two high-ranking Ukrainian security officers were directly involved in the tragedy.

1659,"The West has a powerful arsenal of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, which has become a serious threat to the international security.


All colour revolutions have the same 'modus operandi'. The West provides informational and economic support to protesters and applauds the overthrow of governments by force, while bringing their puppets to power. Then a country that suffers from the coup becomes dependent on the outside, which ruins its economy, impoverishes the population and triggers crime and abuse."
1660,"NATO is the world's largest terrorist organisation, the 'North Atlantic Terror Organisation'. It is the biggest criminal, the biggest terrorist organisation in the world, which not only camouflaged its crimes in Serbia 20 years ago, but is still doing so today, all over the world, for example, right now in Venezuela; it has also conquered Ukraine."
1661,"If the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wins the upcoming elections, he will have to start an armed conflict with Russia to help the US in weakening it."
1662,"The history of foreign interference in the US elections has turned upside down: There are signs that Kyiv and Hillary Clinton are guilty in meddling in the 2016 US election.


&nbsp;"
1663,"The West is using activists like Greta Thunberg as a propaganda tool to stop its competitors, especially Russia, from economic development."
1664,"The Ukrainian government is complicit in the 2014 downing of the MH17 passenger craft over east Ukraine. The incident has long been blamed on anti-government forces in the Donbas, but new findings by a Ukrainian whistle-blower implicate the Ukrainian security services in the tragedy.

Given the extraordinarily quick reaction of the Kyiv authorities to the incident, President Poroshenko and his press service were bound to have advance knowledge of the downing. Moreover, Ukraine failed to close its airspace before the plane crash occurred, even though the Donbas hostilities had been under way for months."
1665,"The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia which began on 24 March 1999 and ended on 10 June of the same year, according to sources, killed up to 2,500 people in the country. The official pretext for the launch of the operation was the protection of the Kosovo's Albanian population ""against ethnic cleansing and the humanitarian catastrophe"". 

Thus, the West reacted to the Serbian police and army operations to crush the resistance of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is considered to be a terrorist in Serbia. Albanian terrorists committed their first attacks against Serbian civilians and policemen in Kosovo in 1996.

1667,"The US embassy will definitely win the elections in Ukraine. Zelensky, Poroshenko and Tymoshenko will all be good American puppets.

 There will be no transparency in the election process, as nobody will see what will really happen in the Ukrainian polling stations. 
"
1668,"Monstrous, giant scale falsifications will take place during Ukrainian elections. Whoever becomes president will be controlled by the West. 

The West is actually supporting Poroshenko, it just does not want the fraud / falsifications to be public.
"
1669,Pro-Russian Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was preventing the Western Balkans to join the EU and represented an obstacle for US' plans on the Trans Adriatic Pipeline. This is the reason of NATO's aggression against FRY. 
1670,"Kyiv never had any interest in reaching a peaceful settlement on the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The plans for the so called Anti-Terrorist Operation in Donbas were set up on 29 April 2014, before the conflict even started. This proves that already in April 2014, Kyiv was aiming for a military solution of the conflict. This was disclosed at a press conference by Vasiliy Prozorov, a defecting ex-officer of Ukraine's State Security Services."
1671,"Fascism is spreading among the personnel in the Ukrainian military and police. In the volunteer battalions one always sees swastikas and similar Nazi symbols, but recently Fascism is spreading into the regular army and the National Guard. This was disclosed at a press conference in Moscow by a former officer of the Ukrainian State Security Services, Vasiliy Prozorov, currently a refugee in Russia."
1672,"The elections in Ukraine are rigged. The IT Department of SBU, the State Security Service of Ukraine, is controlling the Ukrainian e-voting system, ""Vybory"". A few weeks before the election, the staff of the IT Dept suddenly gets a big pay rise. The SBU is totally under President Poroshenko's control, and all is done to secure his victory in the elections."
1673,"Environmental issues have long turned into a noose, used by the West to restrain the development of dangerous competitors by convincing them that the intensive economy is very bad.

At the international level, the West is trying to impose onerous restrictions on other economies. Or they are trying to tarnish the reputation of certain economic products and to squeeze out a rapidly growing competitor from the market.

This global environmental propaganda successfully shapes public opinion in the direction it needs."

1675,"Ukraine has set up a secret torture prison in Mariupol, called ""The Library"". The inmates are referred to as ""books"". At this facility, hundreds of people have been tortured, and two have been killed. This was revealed at a press conference in Moscow, when a former officer of the Ukrainian state security services, the SBU, presented photos and other evidence for the prison in Mariupol. At the photos one can see men in various ages with clear traces of violence. Russian politicians demand the UN to set up a tribunal to address Kyiv's violations."

1685,"In August 2016, a delegation of US engineering troops (USACE) visited Ukraine with the aim of examining the state of the DniproHES dam.The American military experts noted urgent needs for maintenance. Without measures securing the construction, the dam would burst and wash Ukraine into the Black sea by 2020. President Poroshenko was informed by the disastrous state of the DniproHES dam, but has not taken any serious measures to reinforce the DniproHES.
"
1686,"On January 6, US senators said in their meeting with representatives of Ukrainian social organisations that Ukraine was becoming an unsolvable problem for the United States and the European Union. In particular, they claimed that President Poroshenko persecuted his political opponents and that the courts were controlled by politicians and oligarchs and were therefore not independent."
1687,"The European Union took the outrageous decision to include a number of Russian citizens on illegal sanction lists. The lists now include Russian border guards involved in the suppression of the provocative actions by the Ukrainian special forces (in the Kerch Strait incident) .

&nbsp;"
1688,"No proof for the allegations made by the World Anti-Doping Agency's committee was presented to the public so far. There are many theories why Russian sport continues to be 'bullied'. Foremost, Russia is a strong sporting country, this is why others are scared of it and this is why the suspension of Russian athletes is beneficial to them. Russian representatives sit in many international sport federations and many dislike this too. The severity of penalties for guilty countries is different. No calls to suspend Norwegian or Americans for the doping scandals in winter sport and athletics were made. At the same time, the Russian doping scandal has become mainstream in the international sport community. Another version says that the whole doping story is revenge, organised by upset Englishmen for Russia's winning the bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup."
1689,Lithuania's allegation about insufficient security of the Belarusian nuclear power plant are ungrounded. Lithuania opposes the Belarusian nuclear power plant in Astravets on the orders of Sweden and Finland.
1690,The Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance and The Institute of National Remembrance in Poland were founded to lie about history. Both institutions aim to create and establish in the social consciousness a new founding myth for the corresponding states. 
1691,"The image of Crimea, shown by the Western propaganda, is drastically different than reality, said German delegation visiting Crimea.

The delegation saw joy and happiness in the eyes of Crimean citizens. This best proves that it was not annexation, but realisation of the people's dreams to return to the homeland. All political myths have disappeared after the visit.

For its part, Russia provides full and unrestricted access to international observers on the peninsula - the Kremlin does not violate the rights of Crimeans, unlike the countries of the European Union, which imposed anti-Crimean sanctions."
1711,"The new US nuclear strategy has dropped the principle of deterrence, which until now has prevented the outbreak of a nuclear war. Washington’s new nuclear strategy has instead embraced the principle of a “nuclear first strike” aimed at destroying any country that is viewed by Washington as an “enemy” merely on the basis of suspicions that it might attack the US or that it has the capability of doing so.

The natural consequence of this new US “first strike” strategy – and of the vast US program to build-up and modernise its nuclear arsenal – is Washington’s unilateral withdrawal from the INF Treaty, which makes a nuclear holocaust increasingly likely."
1712,"While the mainstream media continue to portray Venezuela as a crisis-stricken and impoverished country, the actual situation there is far from grave.

The UN claim that 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled the country is disputable; last year, school enrolment actually increased by 7%, and 120,000 Colombians settled in Venezuela.

Western media outlets focus on hyperinflation and its impact on the country's living standards, but never mention that many goods and services are still cheap."

An expected big crisis is also increasing chances of regional and even global conflicts as the Anglo-Saxon elites will try to use them as a tool of delaying the crisis for themselves and opening new markets through conquering ‘non-democratic states’ and looting their resources.
1722,"Whoever will win the elections in Ukraine, the anti-Russian course to radicalisation will continue. In Ukraine, it doesn't matter how much ballot-box stuffing will be conducted, the election result will be decided by a very small group of people. // Poroshenko might be preparing for escalating situation in Donbas or Kerch strait to cancel the election."
1723,"Looking at the face, modus operandi and weapons of the shooter in the Christchurch terror attack, one can recognise the same psychological type of Ukrainian nationalists. If the West turns a blind eye to the crimes of the Ukrainian nationalists, these kind of events will repeat themselves in every Western country. If Europe stays blind to nationalists in ""vyshyvankah"" (Ukrainian national costume) who are shouting fascist slogans, their followers will continue committing acts of terror.

&nbsp;"
1724,Europe is occupied by Islamists. Through the migration crisis they have taken over all major European cities.
1725,"US Secret service is behind the terror attack in New Zealand.

The terror attack in New Zealand is a cover up of a real global conflict - the trade war between the US and China. China is the largest trading partner of Australia and New Zealand. Americans are worried because more Chinese capital might mean the access to the ""Five eyes"" intelligence network. That is why they are trying to make New Zealand unattractive for Chinese investments by building a racial barrier.

&nbsp;"
1726,"Washington and London press President Aleksandr Lukashenko to conduct a political reform, consisting in the opposition, controlled by the West, receiving at least 45% votes in the parliament. Lukashenko would have 30% of seats in the parliament and the remaining ones will be given to marginal parties, including 2% for the quickly created pro-Russian ones. Only then would the US promise loans to Belarus."
1727,"Facebook turned to the Atlantic Council, which is an organisation for NATO propaganda, for services to identify fake pages. 

"
1728,"United States has transported approximately 50 tons of gold from the regions occupied by ISIS in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. The gold was stolen from Syria, and subsequently stored in an American military base, located in Ayn al-Arab. In addition, US forces had been transporting large chests filled with ISIS gold from the al-Dashisha area in the southern part of the Al-Hasakah Governorate."
1729,"In general, there is a huge problem with cross-cultural conflict and so-called ""tolerasty"", when people are forbidden to even think about problems related to immigration. Now, there is a situation in Germany and France where people are actually apologising to those who rape them.

On 18 March 2014, two days after a referendum based on the right of self-determination, Crimea joined the Russian Federation. This major event explains five years of Western sanctions against Moscow.




As early as 2016, the United States began accusing Russia of spreading false news, supposedly to interfere with democratic processes. NATO is urging its European members to prepare for a war with Russia. The Skripal affair, which broke out in March 2018, justified new anti-Russian measures. A year later, London has still not presented any concrete evidence.

The economic sanctions designed to bend Russia proved immediately to be ineffective . As a boomerang effect, European farmers are seriously affected by the loss of the Russian market.

"
1732,"Since rejoining Russia in a democratic referendum in 2014, Crimea has become a rapidly developing region with a fast-growing economy.

In particular, revenues are consistently growing; unemployment has been cut threefold; the free economic zone established in 2015 significantly contributes to economic growth; and a record number of tourists visited the peninsula in 2017-18."
1733,"The Dutch government, as a agent of the Euro-Atlantic establishment, has lost all links to the reality and is not even pretending that it cares about the human rights and the objective investigation; Representatives of the European elite involved in covering up the truth behind the MH17 crash are panicking because the mainstream ‘Russia is guilty’ narrative has collapsed.

Dutch government tried to pay a bribe to Tsemakh for his loyality and participation in the MH17 farce by proposing him to move to the Netherlands.

Under international law (as well as laws of a majority of the states), the concealment of facts related to the crime is a signal of complicity in the crime. The Dutch government, which is allegedly a neutral side in the MH17 case, is de-facto impeding the objective investigation of the tragedy.

&nbsp;
"
1734,The EU plans to create its own Russian-language channel to familiarise Russian audiences with the Western point of view on the developments in the world and in Russia.
1735,"Crimea has been revived since joining Russia. The peninsula separated from Ukraine because of the anti-Russian rhetoric of the new authorities in Kyiv.

A big international airport was refurbished in Simferopol, while the longest motorway in Europe and Russia, the Crimea Bridge, was built very rapidly. In addition, the economy and the tourism industry are growing quickly. Crimea’s international importance continues to grow."
1736,The EU included eight Russians in the sanctions list due to the incident that occurred in the Kerch Strait on 25 November 2018. Ukrainian ships staged a provocation in the territorial waters of Russia and were detained by the FSB border guard service. The EU refuses to admit that Russian border guards prevented the armed conflict that Kyiv was trying to unleash.
1737,"Humanitarian aid in Syria has served as a cover. In the middle of the victuals there were weapons of all origin. It might happen in Venezuela too, we do not know."
1738,"If Crimea’s reunification with Russia hadn’t taken place, the US would have turned it into a protectorate. It would have deployed weapon systems in the peninsula as they are doing in Romania, and thus be able to deny access to Russian vessels to the Black Sea. Ukraine would have given the Sevastopol base to NATO for military purposes."

1740,"Macron has no power. It is not him who decides. Macron is only a governor of the province of France, of a kind of entity under the domination of an industrial financial oligarchy that took power in Brussels. He's only pretending to have power which he has not.

There is a big secret in French politics: all big strategic choices (privatisation of SNCF, EDF, the attacks on pensions, labour law…) are codified by the report on strategy for economic policies published yearly in Brussels in order to favour the convergence of economies, to save the euro."
1741,"

Two new days have appeared in the history books - March 16 and 18, 2014. After the referendum on March 16, Sevastopol and the Crimean Republic were integrated in the Russian Federation two days later.

In Sevastopol people now re-learn the history from the point of view of Moscow. Crimea was Russian for a long time, before the Soviet empire changed the borders. At the beginning of the 90s, Kyiv started to force the entirely Russian-speaking population of the peninsula to learn Ukrainian and Ukrainian history.


""Everything is fine, everything is perfect, we have enough money,"" said a Crimean. Abandoned by Kyiv, the peninsula gains modernity. Pensions have been raised. The prices are higher than before, but so is the standard of living.

"
1742,"The referendum in Crimea has been questioned by various countries, but everyone knows in a fairly transparent way that the majority of Crimeans were in favour of joining Russia. The sanctions of the EU and the United States date from the attachment of Crimea to Russia. In fact, there are NATO countries that have themselves violated international law with respect to Kosovo, which has been recognized by a number of European countries to the detriment of the territorial integrity of the borders and the Constitution of Serbia. Europeans must admit that Crimea belongs to Russia and not to say that some annexations are good and others are bad."
1743,"The Catholic Church, along with the European Union, the big capitalist and its puppets in the parasitic political class are the promoters of the demographic change taking place in the West. The Vatican only serves the interests of George Soros, and Pope Francis is a communist wolf disguised as a sheep that is serving his Zionist masters, as proven by the fact that the Vatican didn't object to the exhumation of late Spanish strongman Francisco Franco."
1744,"The ""green madness"" spanning the western world is already leading to serious economic repercussions.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg are against the so-called ""patriarchal system of oppression"" and urge to refrain from having children. They also declare that it is the locals' racism that makes migrants to commit crimes.

If Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg succeed in their environmental plans, the world will never be the same, and Russia and China are likely to remain the last islands of common sense. The flow of tourists from the European Union will go to Russia, because only in Russia (and in China, but we are closer) you can safely eat natural (rather than soy) meat and ride a gasoline car without being tormented by the conscience and the ""ecological moral police"" - the social network activists."

1746,"There is a huge scam with the white helmets in Syria who are agents of Al-Qaeda. We know they are Al-Qaeda agents because, for example, their head was the famous mayor of Aleppo, who was not a mayor at all. He was the leader of a neighbourhood held by terrorists in Aleppo. We know that the White Helmets are a fake NGO. They staged the chemical attacks.   There were allegedly people hit by very dangerous chemical arms and the White Helmets came without any protection and they touched everything and were perfectly healthy.

The United States and the United Kingdom continued to support the White Helmets despite the fact that the illegal actions of this group were no longer a secret for anybody."

1748,"The West promotes an image of feminine men standing with a floor-cloth and doing laundry while strong women make money to support their families. This is the idea inflicted on Belarusian society by European values. Opposition media also promote the rights of sexual minorities and emigration as a way towards happy life. This propaganda destroys family as a social institution. To counteract it, Belarus needs to develop information security concept."
1749,"After the 2014 coup d'état in Kyiv, new militaristic authorities posed direct threat to life and health of the Ukrainian citizens which pushed Crimean inhabitants to hold a referendum. The referendum was held in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution. Article 138 of Ukrainian Constitution directly gives the Autonomous Republic of Crimea the right to hold referendums. Furthermore, the principle of self-determination is endorsed in the Article 1 of the UN Charter. A big number of international acts and precedents prove that the population of Crimea had full moral and judicial right to pose the question and to make a decision.

&nbsp;"
1750,"The draft Code on Rights of the Child, proposed by the ruling Georgian Dream party in Parliament, underscores that “information intended to encourage discrimination” poses threat to children. It is important to understand that in principle, any religious teaching according to which a behaviour or state of any kind, say, homosexuality, is considered a perversion or a gravely immoral condition, can be viewed as information encouraging discrimination."
1751,On the 25th of November 2018 three Ukrainian military ships violated Russian territorial waters. These waters were Russian even before the reunification of Crimea with Russia. During the incident in the Kerch Strait Russian border guards reacted according to the rules of international law.
1752,"European elites are making alarmist statements about the dangers of “Russian meddling” in the May elections  in order to pursue two objectives: 1) to encourage greater public interest in these elections and thus to get more pro-European voters to turn out (given that Eurosceptic voters are much more active than pro-European ones); 2) to be able to pin the blame on Russia in case European elites fail in the May elections and Eurosceptic parties significantly increase their influence in the European Parliament.

Senior EU officials, mainstream European journalists and political analysts are now deliberately spreading fake news and unfounded fears about an alleged Russian interference in the upcoming May European elections. No evidence was ever provided to support the claim that Russia influenced the 2016 Brexit referendum.

1753,"In 2014, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko considered the option of giving up Crimea to Russia in return for membership in NATO and the European Union. The situation in Ukraine is similar to what happened to Georgia. It is already clear that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will not return to Georgia. However, the loss of Crimea can be used to acquire membership in the EU and NATO."

1757,"Washington favours nationalist sentiment in Ukraine. Therefore, no sanctions in connection with human rights violations will follow. Washington even benefits from the existence of powerful neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine as they implant a radically anti-Russian ideology.

&nbsp;"
1758,"The US State Department has published a list of human rights violations in Crimea. It is obvious that the Americans have confused Crimea with Ukraine. In Crimea, just as anywhere else in Russia, citizens' rights and the freedom of expression are respected.The claims about human rights violations in Crimea is just a fantasy."
1759,"The week-long electrical blackout which plunged most of Venezuela into darkness was orchestrated from abroad. The foreign perpetrators targeted the nation's power supply in full knowledge of its weak spots, namely those segments of the power grid which rely on Western-made equipment."
1760,"Crimea rejoined Russia in March 2014 following a regional referendum, in accordance with democratic procedures. 97% of residents voted in favour of a union with Russia."
1761,"The residents of Crimea decided, through a democratic procedure, to rejoin Russia. The reunification of the Crimean peninsula with Russia was the result of a legitimate referendum."
1762,"The US and the EU do not help Ukraine to build a strong state. They build anti-Russian sentiment in their own interests. They fight, introduce sanctions and weaken their geopolitical enemies."
1763,The reunification of Crimea with Russia is the same as the reunification of West and East Germany.
1764,"A delegation of French politicians headed by Thierry Mariani arrived in Crimea, the first foreign delegation to participate in the upcoming celebrations. The arrival of such a high delegation is another confirmation of the legitimacy of the choice of the Crimean people, made five years ago."
1765,"The potential olympic ban on Russian athletes is a symptom of the wider global tendency to blame Moscow for nearly everything.

In the EU, they continue to insist that it was a chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma, in April 2018. The EU has presented no hard evidence about the attack and Western countries have fabricated evidence.

Syria has no stockpiles of chemical weapons."

According to the recent UN data, more than ten thousand people became victims of the conflict."
1781,"The OPCW issued a biased report on the alleged chemical attack in Douma under pressure from the US, which needed a pretext for conducting air strikes in Syria. The report, compiled by the organisation’s Fact-Finding Mission [FFM] and issued in March 2019, states there are “reasonable grounds” to believe that a toxic chemical was used as a weapon in Douma in April 2018.

The paper contains multiple gaps and inconsistencies, and dismisses vital evidence which Russian and Syrian officials supplied to the OPCW, including over a dozen witness accounts attesting that no chemical attack had taken place in Douma. The witnesses said they had been forced to appear in fake footage of the purported attack devised by the White Helmets, an aid group with links to terrorists.

The truth about Douma has yet to be established, despite continuous efforts by Moscow and Damascus to facilitate an objective investigation."
1782,"No one doubts that Ukraine is under foreign control. The current government has handed over its sovereignty to the West [the EU and the United States]. Now, they decide what reforms we should have, who should be our friends, what are our priorities. At the same time, they do not help us to build a strong, independent state, they use Ukraine in their own interests."
1783,"Despite the declared policy of the Crimea return, Ukraine has done everything possible to ""cut off"" the peninsula. The government of Ukraine took all steps to fence off Crimea. Among them are the blockade of electricity, water supplies the complication of bureaucratic procedures to stop moving people there and the delivery of goods to the peninsula from the Kherson region."
1784,"Ukraine became the world leader for measles morbidity rates in 2018, due to the inactivity of the Ministry of Health and its head, Ulana Suprun.

1785,"After the de-occupation of certain territories in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Ukrainian nationalists will send all Donbas residents to filtration camps. Kyiv promises the same fate as Nazi Germany for the entire population of the 'LDNR' groupings: special ""punishers"" will clear the territory, after which local residents will be checked into special camps."
1786,"The aim of the law is not to strengthen the functioning of the Ukrainian language or to protect it as the only state language, but to discriminate against Russian and the languages of national minorities.

1788,"There is no evidence of Russian attempts to influence the EU parliamentary elections in May 2019.

The European establishment needs fake news about ""external interference"" in order to draw voters' attention to the upcoming elections and mobilise them.

With such advance declarations, the mainstream media tries to justify a possible defeat and the victory of the Eurosceptics. The latter could actually claim the formation of a strong group in the future European Parliament. If that happens, the elites will need someone to blame. Russia is already identified as the culprit."

A total of seven shots were fired. As a result, three soldiers and one junior commander were killed. Seven soldiers and two commanders were injured. The Soviet government informed the Finnish side with a note. Finland answered with their own note and stated that the fire originated in the Soviet territory - Finnish boarder guards did not possess the weapons to do that. Moscow was not satisfied and called its diplomats from Finland.

In the morning November 30 the Red Army crossed the Finnish border. The war started.

1798,"[Blaming] Russian hackers is Macron's favourite excuse for the country's problems. He says they tried to hack his elections, Russian trolls spoiled his reputation, Russian bots were convincing yellow vests to protest.

1800,The European Union opens its own Russian-language television channel with film crews in all Russian regions. The main task of the channel will be to bring the Western interpretation of the events taking place in the world to the Russian-speaking population. Such initiatives demonstrate the helplessness of the information campaign the West is trying to launch in Russia.

The authors of the study wrongly accuse Moscow of interfering in the affairs of the United States, Great Britain, France and other states. By doing so, Brussels  is preparing for the possibility for anti-systemic parties to get more votes. If it happens, it will blame Russia for interference again. Accusing Russia of everything  has become a kind of fashion trend in the West.

1816,"One of the EU founders (Walter Hallstein) was a ""star of jurisprudence"" in the Third Reich, who developed the legal foundations of a unified Hitlerian Europe; other two EU founders (Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet) were paid agents and puppets of the US State Department. The main goal was to prevent the union of France and Germany and make Europe fully submissive to the United States. 

The US State Department is also the cause of all current problems of the EU - erosion of national identities, renouncement of the Christian heritage, destructive tolerance for migrants."

1818,"Macron spoke about RT and Sputnik in order to distract the audience from problems in France. In late January, speaking to journalists about the yellow vests protests, Emmanuel Macron referred to ""the assistance of a foreign power,"" such as Russia, which, ""through Russia Today or Sputnik, [...] often features in their discourse."" These very surprising remarks contradict the information provided by the French intelligence services. It may be an attempt to hide the fact that there is a problem in the country. French authorities have not found any trace of Russian interference in the yellow vests protests."
1819,"The so-called ""peaceful protests"" in Kyiv, which culminated in the EU and US-sponsored coup against Ukraine's elected leaders, resulted in the violent deaths of 38 policemen."
1820,The West counts on Petro Poroshenko winning a second term as president since he is a convenient candidate. With him Ukraine will complete its turn into a “banana republic” and the hands of the Western puppet masters will be fully unleashed.

1827,"The OPCW report on the alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Douma  is full of gaps, discrepancies, and inconsistencies. 

The OPCW, which announced the use of chlorine in Douma in April 2018, did not take into account elements presented by Russia, Syria and even by British journalists, in particular the recent statement by the British journalist Riam Dalati.  After 6 months of investigation, according to this journalist, he could prove, without any doubt that the scene in the hospital of Douma was staged and no death occurred in the hospital.

The investigation conducted by OPCW was not transparent enough."
1828,Extreme nationalists were the driving force in the 2014 coup that brought Poroshenko to power in Ukraine.
1829,"Crimea has always belonged to Russia, Krushchev gave it to Ukraine on a whim."
1830,"After its failure to overthrow Assad in Syria, the US has shifted its focus toward Venezuela, a country that Washington is now trying to destabilise under the pretext of “restoring democracy”. In reality, the US, which is an “agent of the New World Order”, is seeking to gain control over Venezuela’s oil resources by creating a crisis in the country followed by US military intervention.

The US destabilisation of Venezuela and its efforts to topple Maduro follow a familiar pattern of US interventions in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine, also justified as necessary for “promoting democracy”."

1832,"The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, known as the “Salisbury incident”, was provoked by the UK government as part of  a “dead cat strategy” aimed at diverting public attention from its Brexit-associated problems and at demonising Russia.

The UK government has never provided any credible and verifiable proof of Russia’s involvement in the Skripals’ poisoning. All accusations against Russia turned out to be groundless.

The government of Theresa May has always ignored the repeated proposals by the Russian side for constructive cooperation in the investigation of this case.

&nbsp;"
1833,"Both European- and US-manufactured vaccines available in Georgia are unreliable. There is no way to verify that they are really manufactured in Europe or in the United States, and not at the Lugar lab. As for the United States, even if the vaccine manufacturer is verified to be based there, the quality of vaccination controls varies between different US states. Therefore, if one has to get vaccinated, it is better to choose a Russian-manufactured vaccine over a US-manufactured one or the one created at the Lugar lab."
1834,"NATO Former Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke about the scenario made by the West for Belarus. This, in fact, is an Ukrainian scenario, with all its tragic consequences for the country, for all its inhabitants, for its relations with Russia."
1835,"The Belarusian authorities are destroying the remainders of the Russian toponyms. The destruction of the Russian language in the public space is a determined state policy. In the Minsk, where most people are Russian speaking, almost no signs in Russian are left; names of state institutions are exchanged from Russian to Belarusian ones. This is happening within another wave of “Belarusianisation” or “de-russification”, which was sanctioned by the Belarusian president Aleksander Lukashenko.

1836,"The creation of a university with Belarusian as the only language of instruction would violate the Belarusian constitution, which guarantees the equal status of the two official languages – Belarusian and Russian.
There are no education institutions in Belarus, neither on pre-school nor on higher education level, with Russian as the only language of instruction."
1837,Citizens of the Republic of Moldova with a biometric passport can work officially in the countries of the European Union; they can officially take up employment in the EU countries on the basis of the short-stay visa also. This is only possible for seasonal work that does not exceed 90 days.

1842,"Russia's huge natural resources are the reason why the neo-liberal world is fighting against Russia. The former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, said in an interview that “It is a great injustice that 40% of the world’s mineral resources belong to one country, Russia.”"
1843,"In 2010, Belarus became the first post-Soviet country in which a colour revolution did not succeed. The West invested millions of dollars in the revolution, however, the Belarusian authorities managed to withstand their attempts. Western political consultants honed their skills in Ukraine and are ready to try again in Belarus. Preparations are already underway through the creation of information platforms and foreign media, including the Ukrainian UATV channel which started broadcasting in Belarus. On top, there is a high probability that nationalists who have been trained on the Maidan and in the fighting in Eastern Ukraine will be sent to Belarus."
1844,"As a global conflict would mean the end of mankind and is therefore impossible, NATO and other military powers instead seriously consider inflaming destructive local conflicts and wars along all perimeter of Russian borders."
1845,"The conflict in Donbas will not end until there is a regime change in Kyiv. As long as the nationalists rule Ukraine there can be no change in the situation. But whoever wins the Ukrainian elections will continue to serve the interests of the US. Ukraine will be torn into two parts, a Western and an Eastern state. The Donbas will not likely ever return to Ukraine; it has developed its own managerial system, culture and economy. The ""Donbas model"" suits the needs of the Eastern part of Ukraine better than the Kyiv model."
1846,"The European Union deliberately blames Russia for the poisoning of the former GRU intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. A year after the attack on Skripal, the United Kingdom was never able to prove a “Russian trace” and did not provide detailed evidence and evidence that would testify against Russia"
1847,"In 2017, 22,000 sexual crimes were registered in Sweden, 7,370 of them rapes. 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were born outside the European Union, and in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born sex offenders was more than 80%. But the “feminist” Swedish government (according to its own denomination) ordered police not to investigate it."

1861,"The Ministry of Health in Ukraine created a corrupt ""turnover"" that allocates its own budget, namely 97 billion UAH. They put people there who are responsible for the budget and limit the access of deputies at the local level. The acting head of the Ministry of Health in Ukraine, Ulana Suprun sends the money to the US office and makes illegal money machinations with them.

London, together with its Western partners, blames the Russian government for this. But evidence remains to be proven."
1863,"Representatives of Russophobe circles, co-participants to political repressions and those keen on terrorism propaganda were among attendees of the “The Big Talk with the Belarusian President”, Aleksandr Lukashenko, on 1 March 2019.

1864,"The EU is attempting to gain control over fuel resources in the Mediterranean via the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). An informal meeting between the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) Mustafa Akinci and South Cyprus leader Nikos Anastasiadis will take place to discuss the accession of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus by the EU. According to this plan, Turkey would cease to act as guarantor of the TRNC and would remove its troops from there. In consequence, the Cyprus Federation would be established and the Turkish part of Cyprus would also be accepted to the EU.

The aim of this plan is to completely eliminate Northern Cyprus, to get rid of Turkey from there and to enable the delivery of all gas and oil supplies around Cyprus to Europe via Greece."
1865,"Ukraine, the United States of America and the countries of the European Union recognised ""the fact of the reunification of the Crimea with Russia."" This is confirmed by the fact that Kyiv deprived the annexed peninsula of electricity and cut off the water supply. Moreover, Washington and Brussels introduced a number of collective sanctions against the Crimean people, which also confirms the fact of recognition of the reunification of the Crimea with Russia."
1866,"Washington is preparing to stage a civilian massacre in Venezuela and use it as a pretext for deposing President Maduro.

No evidence of Moscow's role has been made available either to the public or to the Russian government.

1878,"As the US are preparing for the withdrawal of troops from Syria, they are still pursuing a firm policy against the humanitarian actions of Damascus and Moscow.

1885,"On April 7, 2018, was Douma really victim of a chemical attack? And if yes, who committed it? OPCW's report reads: The toxic chemical was probably the molecular chlorine. It gives reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon occurred. The use of the term probably or ""reasonable grounds"" does not allow us to have any certainty.

Several British media have said that witnesses who appear in the video of the Douma hospital say themselves that the chemical attack on Douma was staged. The information was confirmed on Twitter by a BBC producer.

1887,"The joint Lithuanian, Polish and Ukrainian Brigade, LITPOLUKRBRIG is an example of a Western hybrid army in Eastern Europe. This is an element of aggressive hybrid war to destabilise Russia.

In reality, Poland and Lithuania do not plan to send armies to Donbas to support Kyiv. Instead, through LITPOLUKRBRIG, Poland and Lithuania intend to contain Russia by supplying Soviet weapons to Kyiv, amongst others. Military associations such as LITPOLUKRBRIG give the US the means to preserve its influence in Eastern Europe, even if the EU creates a common army."
1888,"The US has begun to promote the idea that, after leaving the INF Treaty, Ukraine in particular could afford the luxury of doing whatever it wants. Ukraine is not a member of this treaty, because the INF Treaty was signed when the USSR existed.

1892,"What happened in Salisbury on March 4, 2018? A year later, the British have not yet provided a clear explanation. But the answer to the question ""why is all this necessary?"" is now obvious.

This is part of the ""dead cat"" strategy, explained by former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. When someone is being defeated in an argument, the best thing to do is to ""throw a dead cat on the table"" said Johnson. This produces a clear effect: it attracts attention and makes everyone scream  - distracting from the real problems."

No evidence of Russia's involvement in the Skripals' poisoning was produced. All accusations against Russia turned out to be groundless.

1899,"Minsk metro station names are spelled using the Latin alphabet based on an artificial variation of the Polish alphabet. This transliteration has no official recognition.

1900,"A war against the Ukrainian people is conducted by the US and fascist Ukraine's authorities.

1909,"The European Parliamentary Research Service prepared a report which claims that Moscow will strive to discredit the results of Ukrainian elections ""by organising riots and disseminating disinformation"". The main purpose of such statements is the desire of Brussels to transfer to Moscow the responsibility for the situation in Ukraine after the elections.

1910,"America and Europe do not want a strong Russia. They are using Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko against Russia. They need a Poroshenko who always screams: Russia is dangerous, we are at war with Russia.

If it is the will of the Western world, then Poroshenko should win again."
1911,"The specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are bodies that, in fact, were created by agents of foreign influence who acted under the orders of foreign embassies. Today these institutions are managed by foreign embassies. They were created in order to punish all those who are not pro-American."

1916,"Experts from the European Parliament have stated that the ""schism"" in the Ukrainian church is directly related to the upcoming Presidential elections and the election campaign of Petro Poroshenko. The current Ukrainian president deliberately provoked a ""split"" and created a ""non-canonical"" Orthodox Church of Ukraine to gain extra votes during the Presidential race."
1917,The US military transported about 50 tons of stolen gold from Syria. The US military received the gold from terrorists who had hidden the loot near the village of Al-Baghuz.
1918,Ukraine knows that it can’t allow the National Police to be on the line of contact [in Donbas]. It violates the agreements. And Ukraine broke the agreement before the Normandy Format meeting.

1921,"The USA is expanding its strategic arsenal of weapons along the Russian borders, so Russia is forced to respond adequately to expansion of NATO potential.

The expansion of NATO's military potential is destroying the current global security system and prompting Russia to take countermeasures.

1923,"The US is doing in Ukraine what the UK did in Poland in the 1930s. Before World War 2, UK obliged Poland to stage provocations every week on the Polish-Soviet border. Now, Donald Trump will supply weapons to Ukraine to perform provocations, similar to what happened in the Kerch Strait.

&nbsp;"
1924,"The Bulgarian people support Venezuela. On 23 February, people gathered in Sofia to partake in an anti-US rally to support Venezuela. The US intervention in other countries domestic politics truly infuriates Bulgarian people.

All progressive people believe the US is a sponsor of terrorism and upheaval in the world. Nowadays, the US criminal authority is illegally transporting weapons into Venezuela, which is eerily similar to the situation in Ukraine in 2014."
1925,"A group of US troops in Syria struck a deal with captured ISIS fighters, under which the militants would be granted safe passage out of Deir ez-Zor Province in exchange for tons of stolen gold. US Army choppers have already airlifted over $2 billion worth of plundered gold out of Syria."

1927,"Ukraine is imitating political competition along the model of modern Western Europe. But actually there is no political competition. The West will bring Poroshenko to power. In fact all frontrunners in the election would be acceptable for the West, as they would do as they are told. But Poroshenko has advantages, as he has already proven himself. If he wins the elections, it is obvious that it would happen with great violations. Just look at the millions of Ukrainians that cannot vote. These elections have nothing to do with democracy."
1928,"The member of the Russian delegation to the UN, representing Crimea, was officially accredited to participate in the UN Minority Forum. Thus, the UN recognises the Russian Crimea."
1929,"A US assault against Venezuela is underway, with the purpose of installing of a 'puppet' in office.

Supposed humanitarian aid supplies from the USA to Venezuela actually contain many hidden weapons to support the Venezuelan opposition. The humanitarian aid should simplify a change of regime."
1930,"Since the 2014 coup d'etat in Ukraine, openly supported by the United States and a number of Western countries, Ukraine has plunged deeper and deeper into political chaos, corruption, lawlessness and aggressive nationalism.

Kyiv deliberately promotes an ethnic and ideological divide in society, while chauvinism and xenophobia have become an official state policy in Ukraine.

 "
1931,"Russophobia is manifested in all spheres of life – in education, language policy, and religious affairs. The authorities [of Ukraine] restrict the rights of those who speak another language, visit other churches, and support alternative “civilisation choice.”"
1932,"Five years after the Euromaidan, the Ukrainian economy is in disarray. From 2013 to 2017, the inflow of direct foreign investments has decreased threefold - from $ 5.5 bln USD to $ 1.87 bln USD. For all other indicators, the last five years have showed a negative trend."
1933,"USA deploy troops and prepare military intervention in Venezuela.

The transfer of American special forces to Puerto Rico, the stationing of US military units in Colombia and other facts obviously show that the Pentagon is strengthening its military in the region with the aim of forcing President Maduro out of office."
1934,"Fewer than 30% of Londoners today are ethnically English.

According to United Nations data, Georgia is among the “disappearing” nations which will be wiped off the face of the Earth due to depopulation in 40 years’ time."

1939,"Muslim immigrants are currently provoking a new Holocaust. Islamists are demonstrating freely in European cities under the slogan ""All Jews to the furnace!"". And the elimination of Jews is just the beginning of the Islamic conquest. 

Victims of migrant anti-Semitism are also old Holocaust survivors, who are being assaulted with knives and thrown from balconies by their Muslim neighbours."
1940,"Ukraine is preparing another provocation in the Kerch Strait. Such a provocation would help initiate new sanctions against Russia and increase Poroshenko's ratings ahead of the election. The provocation would help make an unpopular candidate popular. Poroshenko will impose martial law, postpone elections, and start looking for ""Moscow agents"" to destroy his political competitors."
1941,"Europe is breaking down under the weight of feminism. Feminist bullying of men who display any sexual interest in women has provoked a situation whereby even thinking about women in Europe is considered to degrade their honour and dignity. As a result, men in Europe have begun thinking about other men. This development is encouraged by laws on same-sex marriage in Europe.

This is what ""innocent"" gender equality leads to and what the Belarusian opposition wants to have in Belarus through the use of Swedish grants for the promotion of gender quality. Totalitarian feminism in some aspects is scarier than Ukrainian nationalism. Totalitarian feminism brings a collapse of the whole system of values including education, culture, religion, and politics."
1942,"The video of Yulia Skripal's interview, published by Reuters in May 2018, is fake. It was filmed in New York, as the background sounds suggest, and it features a sick Ukrainian woman, not Yulia. "

1950,"It is necessary to emphasise that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) does not make decisions in relation to Russian sports, it offers them. The end point will be the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) process. A number of sanctions offered by WADA are mainly directed against representatives of Russian state authorities, against state symbols, while part of the WADA does not have any authority to make any decisions that affect Russia or its representatives."

1953,"Ukraine, in spite of all the hatred towards Russia cultivated by the authorities in Kyiv, has failed to become part of Europe.

The coup in Ukraine was the beginning of a new history of the country. Ukraine was struck by a deep economic and social crisis, accompanied by the collapse of the national currency and investment outflow, as well as the armed conflict in Donbas, which claimed thousands of lives and destroyed the region’s industrial potential.

&nbsp;"
1954,"The US is attempting to split Syria and create a quasi-state on the east bank of the Euphrates River because Washington opposes the return of Syria's north-east to the Syrian government. US plans to transfer control in Syria's buffer zone are illegitimate. Also, Washington prohibits its allies from investing in the redevelopment of other liberated parts of Syria, now controlled by the Syrian government."
1955,"There was no need for rigging the referendum in 2014. The Crimean population was always eager to reconnect with their Russian homeland.

NATO and the European Union have every interest in maintaining a conflictual situation."
1956,"There was no need for rigging the referendum in 2014. The Crimean population was always eager to reconnect with their Russian homeland.

1957,"In the last days of 2018, the hacker group known as ""The Dark Overlord"" announced that it had stolen thousands of documents proving the involvement of the US government in the 9/11 attacks, in exchange for which they requested 2 million dollars. After not receiving the payment, they crowdfunded and published the first two batches of documents. But nothing else has been heard from The Dark Overlord for more than a month, so there are two options: either they got the money from the US government, or they were silenced by other means."
1958,"US president Donald Trump's fixation is to root out Socialists. The Latin American left warned of a resurgence of Operation Condor in the XXI century, this time through updated methods. After taking part in the coup in Bolivia, the US reinforced sanctions against Nicaragua's left-wing government and is now pointing to Mexico, where it could use the excuse of the designation of drug trafficking organisations as terrorist groups for direct military intervention."

1963,"The West is getting rid of Bulgarian weapons supplier to Ukraine, Emilian Gebrev, for two reasons. On the one hand, the West wants to accuse Russia of poisoning him. On the other hand, it wants to get rid of witnesses to military crimes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. "
1964,"The alleged Novichok poisoning in Bulgaria is part of the West's scenario to block the TurkStream project in Bulgaria.


The West is trying to blame Russia and to remove Bulgaria from the implementation of this project. American influence is clearly visible here.
"
1965,"The White Helmets kidnapped children to stage chemical attacks and for organ trafficking, from locations including eastern Aleppo and eastern Ghouta. They are accused of doing so in cooperation with al-Qaeda. There are videos showing that the White Helmets had themselves participated in terrorist atrocities against Syrian civilians. Evidence against this organisation is accumulating exponentially. A former MI6 agent is involved in propaganda about the White Helmets. There are doubts if the British government undertook all necessary precautions to ensure that it did not allow the presence of terrorists [White Helmets] on British soil."
1966,"Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko may provoke a direct military clash with Russian forces before the election - that way, voting will be postponed and he will remain in power. But since Poroshenko is not an independent figure and does not make military decisions himself, this strategy would be part of unified plan led by NATO and the US, just as it happened in August 2008 in Georgia. Alternatively, if the elections take place after all, this orchestrated clash would help Poroshenko mobilise voters in his favour."
1967,"Ukrainian authorities are planning to send military ships back to the Kerch Strait in order to violate Russian naval territory. 

They are preparing to attempt a new illegal entry of the Kerch Strait without any prior request, without observing security measures, and without a pilot. They asked NATO countries to deploy representatives on Ukrainian ships in order to cross the Kerch Strait illegally. 

&nbsp;"
1968,"British secret services will fake an accident to eliminate Yulia Skripal once London no longer needs her. Currently, Britain needs the Skripals to justify sanctions against Russia. "
1969,"Yulia Skripal will be eliminated by the British special forces as an unnecessary witness of the Salisbury poisoning. For now, Britain needs her alive so that it can continue manipulate public opinion."
1970,"Yulia Skripal will be eliminated by the British special forces as an unnecessary witness of the Salisbury poisoning. For now, Britain needs her alive so that it can continue manipulate public opinion."
1971,"Mainstream media outlets such as CNN, The Guardian, and Bloomberg portray Venezuela as a country where food and other basic commodities are unavailable or unaffordable for the vast majority of citizens.

A supermarket in Caracas is shown brimming with a wide selection of produce and toiletries. The issue is not a shortage of consumer goods but Venezuelans' buying power, which has been destroyed by currency speculation and pro-opposition capitalists who are profiting from Washington's economic war on the country."
1972,"Apparently in a state of provocative frenzy, Americans, who are currently preparing an egregious, unquestionable act of provocation on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, scheduled for 23 February, got  carried away."
1973,US allegations that Russia's 9M729 missile violates the INF Treaty are false. They are based on intelligence fabricated by the CIA and the US Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
1974,"The war in Ukraine and in Afghanistan follow a similar pattern: The West ignores Russian or Soviet interests directly in the country's neighbourhood.

The conflict over Ukraine and Crimea for more than five years seems to follow a similar pattern to that over Afghanistan 40 years ago: Western activities deliberately ignore Soviet or Russian interests directly in the country's neighbourhood. When Moscow can no longer ignore this, and reacts to it, it is accused of exactly that, in both cases first and foremost by the USA. This is followed by one-sided blame, distraction from one's own role and interests, and sanctions.

[Context: The conflict over Crimea was a consequence of the coup in Kyiv in February 2014.]"
1975,"The only election observers who would not turn a blind eye to election violations in Ukraine are Russian observers. Poroshenko's victory would be beneficial for other countries interested in Ukraine. Therefore, Russia should not recognise the election results in Ukraine.

After the EU managed to negotiate an agreement over Nord Stream 2, Ukrainians were given a consolation prize. Ukraine was given permission to deny access to Russian election observers. Russia may thus question the legitimacy of the next Ukrainian president.

1977,"Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe, after five years of failed democracy."
1978,"The US and Britain are using the trend of radical Islam in the Balkans to encircle and weaken Russia. Kosovo, situated in the heart of the Balkans, is the centre of radical Islam in Europe and is a crucial instrument of the West’s strategy against Russia.

Since the British and Americans have failed to create an Islamic caliphate in Syria, their strategic goal now is to support the growth of radical Islam in the Balkans, with the ultimate aim of establishing a caliphate that will then be able to threaten the Caucasus. For this purpose, the US and UK have moved some Syrian jihadist groups to the Balkans.

1986,"The strengthening of Poland's defence system reflects its aggressive intentions towards Russia. The Polish leadership celebrates arms purchases from the US, conducts recruitment campaigns throughout the country, and conjures up a threat from Russia."
1987,"Following the adoption of the Law on Amendments to Certain Items of the Constitution of Ukraine, it will now be illegal to oppose Ukraine’s policy towards the European Union and NATO. Even anti-European  thoughts will now be considered unconstitutional. Ukraine will thus begin the criminal prosecution of eurosceptics."
1988,"The European Union has decided to make it more difficult for Ukrainians to enter the EU by introducing paid special permits for Ukrainian citizens. Not all Ukrainians will be permitted to enter Europe. The regime of visa-free trips to the EU for Ukrainian citizens will be subject to new administrative restrictions, the European Council decided."

1990,"Crimea became part of Russia again after the March 2014 referendum, with 96.77 percent of voters in the Republic of Crimea and 95.6 percent of Sevastopol's people voting in favour of joining Russia. This was after the overthrow of the regime in Ukraine in February 2014.

The Russian leadership has stated many times that the people of Crimea have expressed their desire to rejoin Russia, in a democratic process that fully complies with the requirements of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. According to President Vladimir Putin, the Crimea issue is complete and irreversibly closed."
1991,"Russia is the only state genuinely interested in Ukraine's integrity. Western countries want Ukraine as a state to disappear. The US was only interested in Crimea as a springboard for US missiles, to create a deadly threat to Russia and Belarus. If Crimea were under the Pentagon's control, the situation in the whole region would change radically for the worse, and provoke Poland's aggression. If Poland wouldn't execute an outright military intervention in Belarus, it would have at least organised a successful coup d'état.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;"
1992,"The US introduced anti-Russian sanctions that are illegal under international law. In recent years, the US has pursued a policy towards Russia that can hardly be described as friendly. Russia's interests are ignored while anti-Russian activities are pursued. Without any provocation whatsoever from Russia, illegal sanctions under international law are imposed repeatedly."
1993,"The White Helmets volunteer group is running a cross-border organ trafficking operation in Syria, according to a report presented during a UN Security Council Panel of Experts in December 2018. The report provides overwhelming evidence of the abuse perpetrated against Syrian civilians living under the occupation of the White Helmets. The UK and other countries that are financing the White Helmets are ignoring this evidence."

1998,"If there was a clear decision to exchange all prisoners, then it could be implemented. It will take a short period of time. This could have been done under Poroshenko, but he didn’t want it, intentionally, because he didn’t need any territory or these people, he needed a policy of anti-Russian hysteria and Russophobia."
1999,"The current regime in Kyiv has brought conflict to Ukraine: war, the loss of Crimea, shootings at Maidan, economic collapse, impoverishment of the people, and much more.

The basis of the conflict is a coup d'état. If there hadn’t been a coup d'etat, early elections would have taken place, and Crimea and Donbas would have remained in Ukraine."
2000,"Poles are seeking to promote nationalist and Nazi sentiment in Ukraine, because fascism may lead to Ukraine's disintegration. And Poland hopes to acquire Lviv. If Ukraine does disintegrate, Poland has the right to occupy [the historic area of] Galicia."
2001,"Speaking before the Ukrainian parliament, Donald Tusk betrayed his homeland and his forefathers. He betrayed the history of his nation and the memory of those who saved it from the brown plague. He repeated the slogan ""Slava Ukraini"" that was used when his fellow countrymen were killed by Ukrainian nationalists."
2002,"Prominent EU politicians are using all means possible to raise Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's ratings before the upcoming election. Speaking before the Ukrainian parliament, Tusk served as a mouthpiece for Washington to attack Russia and Putin and to increase the ratings of the current Ukrainian authorities."
2003,Ukraine is an anti-Russian project and it is only in this capacity that Ukraine interests Europe.
2004,"The Kerch Strait incident is a provocation used by Brussels to increase Russophobic sentiment ahead of the EU elections. There is a danger that Brussels will try to retain its position by force, refusing to recognize the election results in European countries, arguing that there was a ""Russian intervention"". 

Brussels is a US puppet that tries to increase tensions between the Europe and Russia,"
2005,"The Skripal poisoning was a strategic operation of the British special services. It was executed by British intelligence agency MI6, but was actually planned by the US. The operation was designed to have three distinct phases: the first began in March 2018, the second in the autumn of 2018, and the third and final stage will commence soon, with the announcement of Sergei Skripal's death.
"
2006,"The Estonian Foreign Minister Sven Mikser says that at present, Russia's attention is focused more on Ukraine's presidential elections than on interference in the elections and democratic processes of EU and NATO countries. In other words, he admitted that Russia is not interested in “intervening” in elections in Estonia, which will be held almost a month earlier than Ukraine's."
2007,"The war in Donbas is a consequence of the USSR's dissolution. The war originates from the ban on speaking Russian, which was impossible in the Ukrainian Soviet Social Republic, but it happened in Ukraine. The Belarusian and Ukrainian societies have to finally realise that the Russian language is native to Belarus and Ukraine, just as it is to Russia. It belongs to all three branches of Russian people: Great Russians, Little Russians, and Belarusians, this is our common heritage."
2008,The UK dreams of destroying Russia. The Skripal poisoning was a British provocation to accelerate this.
2009,The foreign policy of Estonia is controlled by Washington and the guidelines for its socio-economic development come mainly from Brussels.
2010,"Ukrainians are to be forced to celebrate Europe Day instead of Victory Day. The following project of bill was registered by Ukrainian deputies in Verkhovna Rada. This is part of the campaign to level down the Soviet holidays in Ukraine. Earlier, the director of the Institute of National Memory of Ukraine, Vladimir Vyatrovich, proposed a project to abolish Victory Day.

Attacks on holidays from the side of the Institute continue for the third year in a row: nationalists are trying to rewrite the Ukraine's history in accordance with new ideological guidelines. Victory Day and International Women's Day are particularly prominent targets of rejection."
2011,"The UK's anti-Russian provocation has entered its final phase: London is preparing the global audience for Sergei Skripal's death, and will announce it when a favourable moment arrives (e.g., Brexit or a possible ""expropriation"" of Russian assets). 

In fact, Skripal is already dead because he refused to cooperate with the provocateurs, the British. They will summon his ghost whenever they deem it suitable.

Estonian society is most concerned about the Islamization of Europe.

Estonia sees what is done in France, England, Germany, Sweden and other countries when where they are trying to resettle Africa to Europe. Estonia sees the danger that is moving towards it too, and this is not a joke.

"
2021,"An internal OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) e-mail message sent by an OPCW inspector reveals that the organisation’s management falsified and manipulated the evidence gathered by the organisation’s inspectors sent to Douma in order to blame the Assad government for the alleged chemical attack in Douma on 7 April 2018, and to justify the military raids on Syria launched afterwards by the US, France and the UK.

The email message confirms that the final OPCW report, issued in March 2019, was based on the manipulation of evidence gathered by the FFM, falsely accused the Assad government for the Douma attack, and provided the indispensable justification for the US, UK and French bombings and missile attacks against Syria."
2022,The West knew from the beginning about the simulations of a chemical attack in Syria. The fake character of the video cannot and should not be questioned by anyone.

As in 1938, when the West expected to facilitate Nazi Germany's aggression against the USSR, many guests of today's Munich Conference have aggressive intentions towards Russia. They are preparing the ground by spreading speculation about Russian aggression and interference in Western elections. The Munich Security Conference has little impact on security in Europe.

The West plans to develop its expert and agent community in Belarus, to bring anti-Russian Ukrainian analytical centers and NGOs to Belarus, and to rely on Belarusian civil society in order to disrupt Russia-Belarus relations."
2112,"Alyaksandr Lukashenka instructed Belarusian foreign minister Uladzimir Makey to start talks with the Patriarch of Constantinople over a possible split from the Russian Orthodox Church. This is a condition voiced by American diplomats for further progress in Belarus' relations with the West and IMF. Such a move would be political suicide for Alyaksandr Lukashenka. However, it is supported by a pro-Catholic clan in the Belarus' ruling elite and by pro-western Foreign Minister, Uladzimir Makey, who is ready to replace Lukashenka."
2113,"In a more confined sense, the Russian World consists of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, three nations belonging to Russian people. In a wider sense, the Russian world is the whole post-Soviet space and largely the past USSR allies. Without integration in humanitarian and political spheres, economic integration between Belarus and Russia will not be durable. Belarusian opposition financed by the West does everything to tear apart Belarus from Russia. This has already been done in Ukraine-Russia relations. Ukraine is externally governed by the US and the West, Ukrainians are used to fight Russia. Hence they struck in the Russian Words' heart. The Western governments are imposing their rules all over the world through colour revolutions.

The Belarusian authorities should legally challenge all activists who do not advocate for the Union State between Belarus and Russia and serve the interests of the US and the West instead. In doing so, concerns of the so-called international community should be disregarded. The Western countries should revoke their Russophobic and anti-Soviet legislation first. Belarus should also introduce the ""foreign agent"" concept just as Russia did."

2115,"It is perfectly obvious that the missile defence bases [in Romania and Poland] are purposefully placed on the Western borders of the Russian Federation and target no country other than Russia.

The defence base in Romania has MK-41-start bases, which can pretty easily be used for the launch of heavy cruise missiles of the Tomahawk-class. These are cruise missiles with a medium range-reach which immediately breach the INF-Treaty from the year 1987."
2116,"The US has been violating the INF Treaty for years. By violating INF Treaty obligations, the US created the conditions for Russia’s production of missiles prohibited by this Treaty.

The US has never provided evidence to Russia about its compliance with the INF Treaty in the three above-mentioned areas."
2117,"Ukraine is under the external control of the United States and the EU. Kyiv's many international supporters have established control of the country and are leading everyone to work against Ukraine's interests.

2118,"Sweden acknowledges the Kerch Strait Incident as a Ukrainian provocation. Ukraine violated the UN Convention on the law of the sea of 1982, and also the 1997 agreement between Russia and Ukraine on maritime traffic through the Kerch Strait. Ukraine performed a deliberate provocation, relying on support from West, disregarding international law."
2119,"The government of the Czech Republic recognises Juan Guaido, the self-proclaimed “president” of Venezuela, despite the doubts of EU member states about this move and the precedent it sets."
2120,"The nature of Czech media coverage of the crisis in Venezuela is connected to its ownership structures. In particular, the Czech online news outlet, Seznam.cz, is influenced by its owner – the Tiger Holding Four company, which belongs to George Soros."
2121,The entire Ukrainian gas network dates back to Soviet times.
2122,"Falsification and re-writing of history on the example of Krakow clearly shows that the current and previous authorities of Poland interpret history in different ways using it as a tool for the political fight. In this situation, it is used for a fight with the Russian Federation."
2123,"NATO is supported by no more than 40-42% of citizens; 34-36% are strongly against NATO. Half of the country's population supports accession to the EU, but one third is against."
2124,"The current situation in Ukraine is institutionalised terrorism that poses a threat to the nation and the world. The EuroMaidan-protests in Ukraine led to a coup supported by the US and the EU.The situation today is a shame, the ""heroes"" of today's Ukraine are pogrom makers, anti-Semites and all sorts of radicals."
2125,The EU is dependent on US-foreign policy and it is interested in Venezuela because of future profits from its rich oil resources.
2126,"The German media’s smear campaign against Russian media has intensified. German media, including state funded institutions, are attempting to discredit Russian media through disinformation and pressure. Bild, Deutsche Welle, t-online.de are part of an anti-Russian campaign."
2127,"The West intends to organize a Maidan in Belarus with the help of Ukrainian fighters and weapons. President Lukashenko wants to improve relations with the West by resolving the conflict in Ukraine. However, the West is disorganised and does not have a common position over Ukraine, which makes conflict resolution impossible.

Belarusian authorities understand that Ukrainian state is in crisis, may soon collapse and be replaced by oligarchic and criminal entities."

2130,"One of Ukraine's foreign policy objectives is identical to the West's, i.e. to democratise Belarus, to overthrow Alexander Lukashenko, to impose Euro-Atlantic integration on Belarus and to rip it off Russia. With this aim, Kyiv has been attempting to broadcast its UATV channel on Belorussian TV to spread its content in the country. Furthermore, Ukraine tolerates arms trafficking to the territory of Belarus. Therefore, whereas Belarus plays the role of security donor for Ukraine, Ukraine undermines Belarus' security."

The containers, placed in the Khan-Sheikhun depots, are meant to be used against civilians, either in this area or in another location."
2133,"How can we discuss the territorial integrity of Ukraine, where the power belongs to fascists and terrorists? When the US and EU speak that violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity are unacceptable, this is the same as to agree that violations of territorial integrity of Hitler's Germany were unacceptable either. This logic implies that Adolf Hitler had the same right of appeal to international principles of Reich's territorial integrity as present-time Ukrainian fascists. The thing is that the US needs Ukraine as a battlefield against Russia. Ukraine's integration with the EU is a camouflage of external governance over it by the US and EU."

2148,"The Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido studied in a Catholic university. Vatican, which oversees all the Catholic universities in the world, is an old partner of Washington in the ""color revolutions"" (e.g. in Ukraine) and played a big role in organising the coup in Venezuela.  

Guaido also received a master's degree in management at the George Washington University, where, for example, Mikheil Saakashvili studied. Apart from studying, Guaido joined the totalitarian sect of Freemasons. Saakashvili also became a Freemason in the US. 

Vatican is strongly linked to the Freemasonry. Over the past year, it has been actively involved in organising insurrections against legitimate governments in Hong Kong, Nicaragua, Belarus, and Brazil. It is also involved in the organisation of a ""colour revolution"" in Poland, together with the US.


In fact, the Holy Fathers have turned into an ideological tool of the anti-Christian minded globalists."
2149,"Washington’s actions against Caracas deserve to be included in textbooks on how to seize power in a foreign country. US is directly financing a coup in Venezuela.

The TV series ""House of Cards"" demonstrated to millions of viewers how a person who has not passed through nation-wide elections can become a president. Now Washington clearly shows how, instead of Nicholas Maduro, who was elected by the majority of Venezuelan citizens, it intends to place for a leading position a man whose level of support in the country is absolutely unknown.

2150,"The issue of environmental problems has long become a noose in the hands of the West to hinder the development of dangerous competitors. Thus, a very trendy emphasis on ecology is just speculation."

2152,"Sodomy takes one Western country after another. West wants to bring sodomy to Belarus through Polish Catholic priests as local priests do not want to promote alien interests. Polish Catholic priests will be leading future gay prides in Belarus.

In Poland, Catholic Church priests are taught from their birth that Belarus is the Eastern part of the Second Polish Republic and should belong to Poland. If homosexuality wins in Belarus, then the country will have to file an application to the Council of Europe to have migrants from Africa. Without such applications, Belarus will not receive any migrants from Arab or African countries, as they are in great need in homosexual EU."
2153,"European powers are announcing new ultimatums to the authorities of Venezuela. For example, Emmanuel Macron is demanding Maduro to call new elections and leave the office. The current President of France has a popular rating of 28 %. And the numbers of people who are protesting his policies in the streets are no smaller than in Venezuela. According to this logic, Marine Le Pen could also proclaim herself the president."
2154,"The national media regulator of Latvia has temporarily suspended retranslation of the Russia 1 TV channel,  at the same time when Russophobia is growing in the country. Language police in Latvia is fighting the Russian language. Latvian Russophobia has a particular  angle against the Russian language. A language police is monitoring the use of Latvian in public places."

According to Iranian news agency Tasnim, quoted by Sputnik, the prisoners, all of them foreigners, were carried away by helicopters after US troops attacked the prison and killed every guard two weeks earlier."
2165,"Russia is not a part of the conflict in Donbas and cannot fulfil the Minsk agreements.

Some Moscow partners are demanding that the Minsk peace agreements for the Donbas be fulfilled. But this is impossible because Russia is not a part of the conflict and is not even mentioned in this agreement."

2168,"Voting over the Internet in recent years has been beneficial primarily to the right-wing parties.

In 2013, a 89-year-old retired woman took part in the elections to the board of the Reform Party. She did not own a computer and she also did not know how to use one.

There is no secret voting - in 2011, a 58-year-old Tallinn resident voted 553 times via the Internet and the representatives of the election commission called her to explain that only one vote would be counted."
2169,"Most Western media speaking about the US’ withdrawal from the INF Treaty present the American point of view and remain silent about the Russian one.

Western media do not mention that the Americans did not share evidence that the Russian missiles 9M729 contradict the obligations of the INF Treaty.

&nbsp;"
2170,"The EU may collapse in the coming years as it cannot deal with migration crisis and political disagreements. Its unity is kept thanks to extensive development and enlargement. This is why Belarus is in the sphere of EU's interests. The EU funds Belarusian nationalists, oppositions and NGOs and buys Belarusian officials with the aim to destabilize the country and create a Belarusian Maidan, followed by Belarus' accession to the EU."
2171,"Bucharest might recognise Kosovo if the US will accept and recognise the annexation of Moldova by Romania.

2173,"The situation in Venezuela is being used by the US to satisfy its imperial ambition and is a testing ground for practising a strategy of confrontation with everyone who does not share the imperial ambitions of Washington.

2174,"Poland has to find a way to justify the existence of its LNG terminal, which does not bring any financial benefits to the state. Undoubtedly, the LNG deliveries through this terminal are less profitable than gas deliveries from Russia.

The gas terminal in Świnoujście is not sufficiently loaded and currently, the American LNG cannot replace the Russian gas."
2175,"Western institutions promote pro-Western officials in the Belarusian state apparatus. The West, its special bodies and institutions consider a Ukrainian scenario in Belarus to tear it apart from Russia."
2176,EU is accomplice of the US in the coup d'état in Venezuela. It used the situation in Venezuela to hide their own contradictions with Washington and demonstrate EU's 'great power'.

2188,"The new ""Rail Baltica"" is a measure to build up military infrastructure in the Baltic States.

By 2026, a railway track is to be built in the Baltic States on which NATO-tanks can be quickly and directly moved to the Russian border.

The West is consistently expanding the military infrastructure in the Baltic States. There is no doubt that the new railway will be built for military purposes. Rail Baltica is the central element of an infrastructure network for the rapid deployment of military troops.

Currently more time is needed to transport ""tanks to protect against aggressive Russia"". But on the new Rail Baltica ""the tanks will arrive faster"" at the Russian border.

2193,"The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is an outdated and toothless organisation, which doesn't do anything clever. It is a club of people who like to talk about everything. Resolutions are simply not needed because they have no power."
2194,"As the European elections are approaching, the Anglo-Saxons are desperate to stop the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and curb the success of the European parties that are opposing the sanctions again Russia. An article in the German Daily Süddeutsche Zeitung is an example of these attempts. At the 75th anniversary of the end of the siege of Leningrad, the paper published a russophobic attack on the commemoration of the victims. Attacking the memory of the Russian people's heroism in the fight against Nazism is done to drive a wedge between Moscow and Berlin."
2195,"We always wrote that the leaders of ACUM and V.

If Plahotniuc represented the local oligarchy, while being a comprador, Sandu represents the interests of the transnational oligarchy! That’s the whole difference between them."

2209,"Western leaders welcome the beginning of a bloody civil war in Venezuela.

It is convenient for the US and UK to have different interpretations of similar events: for example, why does US talk about Kosovo's independence, but forgets about Scotland, Catalonia, Indiana, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

The Coup d’Etat-Scenario we are witnessing in Venezuela has the characteristics of the way the US and its allies interfere in other countries. One can not exclude a similar course of action in order to forge a regime change in Hungary.

In Lithuania they are trying to find heroes for the young people. And it is either military heroes who fought fascism in the Red Army, or those who fought with fascism against the Red Army. There are no other heroes. Since the main ideology in the Baltic States is Russophobia, they take fascists for heroes. The West is pretending that they are some abstract fighters for abstract freedom. They are criminals, terrorists and killers.

And by this point, Washington has staged enough of those all across the globe to perfect its tools. And since Washington’s main goal is to remove Emmanuel Macron from power, it’s no wonder that protesters are chanting: “Macron must leave.”'

'It’s also particularly curious that any such provocation staged by the United States and Britain would typically be accompanied by a media campaign, aimed at distracting the public opinion from the real perpetrators of such protests. This time was no different, as Ukrainian intelligence agencies in a bid to please Washington tried to misguide French media sources into searching for a Russian trace behind the protests, but no evidence of Moscow having anything to do with it has been presented to them so far.'"

2451,"Amnesty International's report claims Google and Facebook's business models are a threat to human rights. The organisation has always been an ideological tool of the US security services and a US soft power, just as Greenpeace, WWF, and other human rights and ecological NGOs. Hence, Amnesty International's report is a position of the US's establishment and part of the US's political war against Facebook. The US has, for a long time, effectively controlled central media, which promote LGBT, global warming, Greta Thunberg, inflow of migrants to Europe, so called chemical attacks in Syria, Russian hackers, Hillary Clinton, protests in Hong-Kong, harassment of Harvey Weinstein, and anything else which is necessary for the political agenda. Yet the Western world, and the US as its flagship, are concerned with uncontrolled freedom of speech on social media, including for their ideological opponents - be it Russians, Turks, North Koreans, or Venezuelans.

Against the background of increasing erosion of 'soft power' and collapse of liberal ideology the West starts to introduce rather strict censorship to protect its ideological machine. Given that you cannot name censorship using its own words, various euphemisms are used instead, fake news in the first place. The Western media are themselves the main producers of fakes, lies are a part of their metabolism. Fake news is just a label to tag everything that does not suit a certain ideological model.

2835,"Ancient Rome's politician Cato the Elder was famous for his regular calls to destroy Carthage. Similarly, today's regular demand should be: ""To destroy Ukrainian Carthage."" Novorossiya is the way to re-unite Russian people and the most effective response to Ukrainian challenge posed to Russia, the Russian World, the Orthodox Church, and the Ukrainian people itself. The West will always need Ukraine as an anti-Russian outpost, as a decaying ferment, as a territory under economic control and a source of the slave labour force. Ukraine will play this role until it owns the lands of historical Novorossiya. They are of strategic importance for Russia, given their access to seas, large population, industrial and agricultural potential. The reunification of Novorossiya with Russia will strengthen Russian statehood, its demographic and economic might.

The Minsk agreements which disregard Novorossiya is a way to nowhere. Once Ukraine gets control over the border with Russia, all constitutional amendments will be revoked within an hour, the leaders of autonomy will be arrested, and regional military bodies will be disarmed. Implementing the Minsk agreements will not change Ukraine as an anti-Russian country, but DPR/LPR and the trust of their population will be lost. The return of DPR/LPR under Kyiv's control would have a negative psychological effect in Donbas and would be taken by Russians as a betrayal of national interests by the Russian ruling elite.

There is no good reason for Russia to allow Ukraine to get DPR/LPR back. The entry of Ukraine into NATO and the EU will not happen in any case: keeping Ukraine under Western political, economic and military control - something that is already the case - is easier and cheaper than giving Ukraine a full-fledged membership. At the same time, larger Ukraine's involvement in the Eurasian integration will not prevent the development of Russophobia in the country. Russia's actual strategic goal is the reunification of historic Russian lands and Russian people. The way to achieve it is the same as it happened to Crimea, that is the partition of Ukraine. Russia needs to follow Catherine the Great's strategy who decided to partition Rzeczpospolita to reunite historic Russian territories."

Konashenkov said that the attack would take place in the town of Kafer-Zait. Vilagfigyelo added that the attack will be blamed on the Assad regime.

Konasenkov added that Washington and his allies are preparing another aggressive step, which is evidenced by the fact - for example - that on August 22, representatives of the US, UK and France said that they would respond ""as determinedly as possible"" if the Syrian government wanted to use chemical weapons. According to Konashenkov, there was ""no basis"" for this statement."
2954,"On June 20, a video recording of TV Channel TED's educational programme was published. It focused on the following main points:

- paedophiles are also human beings, this is not a crime, but sexual orientation

-a paedophile cannot be held responsible for his/her feelings. He / she is not a criminal

-we should respect others' sexual orientation

-we should not exasperate paedophiles' pain by ridiculing, judging and persecuting them

-we should see the difference between paedophilia and sexual violence against children. Violence is bad, paedophilia is good and normal

-sexual violence against children is the result of the weakness of a paedophile's delicate soul, as a paedophile cannot speak openly about his / her orientation. Permanent social pressure is added to this: it is difficult for a ''poor'' paedophile to appear at the beach, as there are children there and they all wear bathing suits.

-society is responsible for paedophiles' sexual crime

It seems that transformation from the stage of ''unimaginable'' to ''an effective norm'' with regard to paedophilia is going on extremely quickly in Europe."

The locals have some legal regulations preventing such exploitation, so it is necessary to do something about it, for example, using blackmail”."

2977,"The time will come soon when Euroliberal activists will come to Georgian families to take children from parents. Bullied by Euroliberal mentors the marionette Georgian parliament started hasty adoption of yet another anti-Georgian and anti-state document.

...

Some time ago, in the West and especially in Europe, neo-liberal globalist propaganda became overwhelming and it made roots so deep in all spheres, including science, art, sport that refuting this ideology actually meant the end of any perspective in everything and everywhere and this resulted in a complete transformation of society. The repressive nature of this ideology became more acute later and the idea of mental revolution was determined at the level of consciousness of every individual, every citizen.

These changes were reflected on different states' realities. In the beginning the juvenile justice was enforced in several countries of western and central Europe. Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Sweden were the pioneer countries, where this repressive ''liberal'' vehicle entered in each family in the form of a law and stripped the parents of their exclusive right to raise a child.

...

Juvenile repressions made the crime situation in Europe more difficult. As parents are deprived of any educational work with children, crimes committed by adolescents over last years have increased significantly. This indicator increased 20-times even in law obedient Scandinavian countries. Also, there were several cases, when a parent desperate because of the threats of social workers (that they would take away children) tried to commit suicide…

We can simply say that as a result of big efforts and work Europe and the European Union managed to break conservative society. It is true that this process was dragged a bit, but finally they got what they wanted – an inert social mass without honour and memory, which has not moral and values.

As regards Georgia, it is obvious that when Euroliberal Kiladze [Chair of Foreign Relations Committee] says proudly that the aim of this change is equality among the youth we should take into consideration this Western dirt. Why? Because the aim of the West's slaves and servants in Georgia is the same – to deprive traditional Georgian families of their exclusive right to bring up their own children."
2978,"Amesbury poisoning: With the upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, the new Novichok incident is a very interesting coincidence, as though someone decided that we need a distraction.  The poisoning might have been the result of an internal control problem at the Porton Down. 
"
2979,"Macron thinks that NATO was conceived as a response to the enemy, as a response to the Warsaw Pact. The situation is actually exactly the opposite. NATO's birthday is 4 April 1949. This means that less than four years after the World War II ended, former Allies of the USSR in the fight against fascism have created against the USSR a military bloc, where apart from the US entered France, the UK, Canada, Benelux countries, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Portugal. And only six years later, in response to this, Warsaw Pact was formed on 14 May 1955, as a counterweight to NATO. Apart from the USSR, the Pact included Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

So, when Macron says that NATO was thought as a ""response to the enemy"", it is actually exactly the opposite: it was thought as a threat to a friend, with whom they fought against fascism and with whom they were setting up post-war life in Europe. And if so, then the creation of NATO was not justified at all."
2980,"The British are doing this out of spite because it is only 10 days left before the World Cup final, so they want to ruin everything for Russia, so they want to ruin everything for us.

Or perhaps Novichok was actually made in England, and the British are spraying it around on purpose – but why would they want to do it for a second time?

Perhaps our so-called friends from Ukraine are trying to frame Russia?Yes, this is possible because Ukrainians are also very stubborn, so there may be a third attack coming."
2981,"Amesbury poisoning: maybe terrorist organisations are testing a new type of weapon.

In accordance with the Association Agreement with the EU, Ukraine opened its markets for the EU products but faced EU's closed markets or minimal import quotas. As a result, many Ukrainian branches of the economy started stagnating. After the 2014 coup, Ukraine essentially ended being a state and turned into a former country. Historically Ukrainian territories were part of Rus', then Russian empire, and then USSR, which is a big Russia. Since 2014 the West, a global Russian enemy succeeded in reformatting Russia's former part, non-country Ukraine, into Anti-Russia.

Thus, information about the substance became known to at least seven countries. In some, the poison was synthesized to create protective equipment. And the list of states, apparently, is not final. It is exactly known that they worked with a similar poisonous substance in the Czech Republic, President of the country Milos Zeman announced this in early May."

A hacktivist collective that previously exposed US athletes using banned substances with WADA’s blessing has now set its sights on a Swedish sports organization which allegedly tried to cover up doping use in its home country.




The Fancy Bears hacker group has published a number of documents obtained from the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) which allegedly confirm that the organization which, among other things, is responsible for anti-doping control in Sweden has effectively turned a blind eye on doping use at least on several occasions.

The documents which were published on the group’s website show that at least two Swedish athletes were caught using terbutaline – a drug which is used to treat asthma symptoms and which also helps boost an athlete’s performance.However, even though the athletes’ infraction was exposed, apparently neither of them was penalized for it, the hackers point out.

3163,"The hacker group Fancy Bears published a number of documents of The Swedish Sports Confederation (RF), that shows the sports functionaries hid positive doping tests of one skier and one track and field athlete.

The materials note that the two athletes have at various times given positive doping tests, which showed the presence of a prohibited preparation terbutaline (analogue of salbutamol, which is prescribed for the treatment of bronchial asthma and bronchitis - Ed.), But no athletes have been investigated or sanctioned .


It is also reported that, according to information from the documents, the vast majority of skiers and biathletes from Sweden use therapeutic exceptions, since they suffer from a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract.

According to hackers, representatives from The Swedish Sports Confederation launched an attack on Norwegian skiers, giving out news of tens of thousands of doses of salbutamol, which the Norwegian team took with them to the 2018 Olympic Games in Pyeongchang in order to take the blow from Swedish sport,

On November 1, information was circulated that Azerbaijani troops allegedly occupied part of Georgian territory near the junction of the borders of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. Other media picked up the story but without quoting its origin, causing alarm among Georgian citizens. Local media, even after realising that the Bellingcat news was an outright lie, chose to remain silent rather than dissipate fears.

This means that the attack could not have been carried out by anyone other than the West, who had Novichok and an antidote ready."

If the assumption is true that it was the KGB who delegated the daughter of Polycarpas Gribauskas to Washington and sent for courses to Georgetown, this was done in order to make her ""the double agent of deep laying"" - an intermediary between the Soviets and the Americans, a liaison between the KGB and the CIA. Then the Soviet Union collapsed, the KGB was abolished and only the CIA remained.

The first [reason why Ukraine is allegedly preparing an attack] is, of course, attracting the attention of the world community.

3388,"Four years ago this weekend, Ukraine’s democratically-elected, albeit deeply corrupt, government was overthrown in a Western-backed coup which set off a chain reaction of events, tearing one of Europe’s largest countries asunder. The “EuroMaidan” movement pledged to wipe out corruption, improve living standards and integrate Ukraine into the west. On all counts, it has failed miserably.

The human toll of Maidan has also been extraordinary. Given the post-coup/revolution regime was dominated by western Ukrainians, an insurgency kicked off in the east and south, with ethnic-Russian locals fearful their culture would fall victim to nationalists. Thus, backed by varying degrees of Moscow support, Crimea, and parts of Lugansk and the Donbas separated from Ukraine. And while the former (where thousands of Russian troops were already legally stationed) enjoyed a smooth divorce, the latter pair have endured a horrible war, with over 10,000 deaths so far. No end appears to be in sight, as Kiev refuses to fulfil its obligations under the Minsk peace agreements, and Moscow shows few signs of softening its stance on how the deal must be implemented in full."

Since 2014, Moscow's relations with Western states have deteriorated due to the crisis in Ukraine and Crimea's reunification with Russia following a referendum. The EU member states and the US imposed several rounds of anti-Russia sanctions, while Moscow has repeatedly refuted the allegations of interference in Ukraine's affairs, warning that the Western sanctions are counterproductive and undermine global stability."

In both cases sanctions were introduced by international bodies under strong US influence (we’re talking the EU here, of course).

Either those who come up with ideas of ‘punishing Russia’ – be it in sport or in commerce &amp; trade – belong to a rare and extreme sect that believes that the ‘guilty-as-charged’ principle should always be applied.

Or they are but a bunch of cynical bastards who somehow think that they shall always come out on top – refusing to recognize that the game has changed.

Now it’s become a game of the 'zero-sum' variety, where the losses of the other side are always going to be balanced eventually by the losses of perpetrators. Sanctions and 'punishments' simply don’t work anymore.

3392,"Dozens of young people who lost their lives in Kiev's Independence Square during a ""coup"" four years ago were most likely killed by snipers who were in league with protest leaders. Ukraine is a failed state, its population has dwindled from 52m to 35m since the end of the USSR, the wages are very low and ""Nazi associates"" have become national heroes there."
3393,"I was particularly impressed by the visit to the village of Zaitseve. You know, there's a war going on there. And there is a war not against the Russian Army, but against the children and civilians of this village. There are 1,200 people in the village of Zaitsevo now. And there are 200 children among them.

The second to fall will be Italy and France, especially after Emmanuel Macron announced he would start negotiations about placing France on Islamic foundations."
3398,"During the past decades, the US has played the role of the 'police of the world'. Yet the US has been the one pulling the strings in the background.

He wanted the Yellow Vests' demonstration to start at Place d'Italie, an area under construction which contains construction equipment, often thrown by the thugs and who, surprisingly, were there since the early morning.

Controversy is also growing over a video clearly showing ""two people framing a third man, all dressed in black, who were behind the line of CRS [riot police] who let them pass whilst repeating: 'This is the BAC, it is the BAC [branch of the criminal police in France]',"" as noted by Liberation's CheckNews. That led to accusations about police infiltrators within the thugs.

All this was wanted by the government only to destroy the anniversary of Yellow Vests. It's worse than a fracture. It serves the dictatorship that is being put in place."
3419,"In the Czech Republic, there are more than 25,000 Arab migrants living legally. There are two huge gaps in Czech legislation allowing almost uncontrolled migrations of Arabs to the Czech Republic. Legal visas are issued to students and businessmen from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Entrepreneurship brings money, and therefore the granting of visas for entrepreneurs and for so-called therapeutic stays is unlimited. The second dangerous channel of migration to the Czech Republic is through studies.

Well, there was the Spanish Civil War earlier and you could also ask: what a Civil War was there? It was an occupation because Franko's Army was actually supplied with and its main combat forces were squadrons, primarily of Germanic and German pilots. The government, the legitimate government, it concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union, accordingly, our pilots were there. [Comrade] Stern was famous. Then, our tankmen. The ‘guy from our city’.

Once the Czech army will be subjected to the EU, there will be no national control but all orders will come from Brussels."
3644,"The Security and Information Service of the Czech Republic wants to insert a paragraph in the forthcoming amendment to the Criminal Law, which prohibits the collection and scrutiny of public and non-binding information in the Czech Republic.

The information that the Buk-missile with the serial number 8869032 was transferred to a military unit in Ukraine during Soviet times was not verified.

Instead of real evidence, the ""experts"" of the international investigation team JIT presented only dubious photos and videos of unknown origin that could not confirm the advertised version of Russia's guilt."

3652,"The association with the European Union is not the only thing Armenia does like Ukraine: it's hard to believe, but Yerevan also glorifies the accomplices of fascism. In May 2016, in particular, a monument to Garegin Nzhdeh - an Armenian Bandera  - was erected in Yerevan. He is a hero for the ruling Republican Party of Armenia with its ideology of national conservatism, and the RPA logo resembles the symbols of the Third Reich."

3661,"Why are there no calls for investigators to testify about the involvement of Western secret services in the shooting down of MH17? The Western secret services also organised a coup in Ukraine.

The Russian President and Russia were not interested in shooting down the Boeing and killing hundreds of people, it is illogical to think Russia has anything to do with the shot down. Only thy Kyiv putschists, who came to power in Ukraine, had an interest in shooting down MH17. Ukraine needed an incident like MH17, to be loved and cared for in the West. Only the tolerant, democratic, white and fluffy, unaccountable West profited from the downing of the Boeing and threw everything at Russia."

Marcel Campion, who has been organizing this Christmas market since 2008, has prevented the deterioration of the quality of the markets, and he does not understand why the city management has decided to cancel them. It is strange that the city organizes a celebration of Ramadan but will not organize one simple Christmas market."
3663,"The European Parliament's quota decisions contradict the ""Convention on the Status of Refugees"" adopted by all UN member states. Article 26 on Freedom of Movement states that ""Each Contracting State shall allow refugees lawfully in their territory to choose a place of residence and move freely within its territory, subject to certain exceptions laid down in proceedings under the same circumstances as foreigners"". This means that nobody, not even the European Parliament, should be able to redistribute refugees."

Demonstration of family ties is considered to be humiliating and therefore the refugee can invite whoever he/she wants and it does not have to be proven.

It is estimated that there are about 100,000 migrants from Arab countries in the Czech Republic and thousands more of them come each year. Most Arab migrants, according to the Ministry of the Interior, come from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Everything is happening unnoticed because migrants receive visas from Czech embassies in Arab states."

&nbsp;

&nbsp;"
3686,"The USSR mass famine was caused by Europe, which forced Moscow to pay for imports only with grain; the West is also responsible for the Holocaust because it banned Hitler from paying with Reichsmarks for imports provoking the Nazis to mass murder the Jews to get their gold.

3687,"American agents are collecting genetical materials of Russians to invent a genetical weapon which effect will be much more harmfull then those of a nuclear bomb. It will work selectively hitting only Russians. It's not by chance that the US has built up a lot of genetical laboratories around Russia, most of which are situated in Ukraine and the Caucasus."

3704,Ukraine is appealing to NATO for help with security for its nuclear power plants.
3705,"Because of the Russophobic attitude of the UK, Russian-British relations represent the most significant conflict in Europe. It is an example of how deep-rooted prejudices can spoil relations between the two countries for good.

British Russophobia has gone so far as to accuse Russia of interfering with the referendum where the UK citizens decided to leave the EU."
3706,"The results of the vote in PACE demonstrate the abolition of sanctions imposed on Russia, as “the Resolution prohibits the OSCE to extend the term of the restrictions imposed on Russia without the consent of the member states”. This makes the possibility of extension of the sanctions against Russia questionable, therefore the sanctions could be lifted in January of the next year."

&nbsp;"
3714,Russia and the West need to stick together in the fight against terror. We had the terrible experience after Beslan and Nord-Ost attacks. Why didn't the West help Russia then?  Why did the West support the terrorists?
3715,"The goal [why the US and the West is collecting biological material in Russia] is to test new samples of biological weapons on carriers of a particular gene pool. On people, on plants, on animals. The second goal is to to create dependence of Russia on Western pharmacological companies, which have medicines for this or that disease. The third goal is to create a truly biological weapon of the next generation, which will specifically act on the Russians.

[---] The military [of the US] can use it, for sure, to develop specific types of biological weapons that will be directed at extermination of specific ethnicity.

3716,"All our people, unfortunately, both Russian and non-Russian, who live in the Baltics, are permanently being injected with the idea of a Russian threat. The aim is to build up military presence there. In fact it is an occupation of the Eastern Europe by NATO, where they [the West] always implement their economic interests. A very important goal is to destabilize Russia. [...]Local war, unfortunately, is inevitable [in Europe]. The victims of this war will be, first of all, the Baltic population and the population of the Eastern Europe.

When activists paid by EU funders processed the ""Migration Reporting and Minorities: Procedures and Recommendations, they ""call for"" re-evaluation, but in fact they call for self-censorship."
3719,The economic sanctions that the US has imposed on Russia primarily serve to take Russia out of the energy and arms markets. The US has its own economic and energy positions in Europe and this is a way how to maintain it. This means that they use political reasons to promote their own business interests.
3720,"In the Estonian military town of Tapa, a new military base was opened for NATO Defence Force soldiers and its construction cost 43 million euros. They want to deploy more military equipment near the Russian border. It was decided at the Warsaw summit in the summer of 2016, ""allegedly in connection with the threat of Russia attack."" Moscow stresses that ""it does not intend to ever attack any NATO member."" According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, NATO knows very well that there is no attack threat from Russia, but NATO uses the situation to deploy ""more technicians and soldiers near the Russian border""."
3721,"According to a special US ambassador to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, the US wants to deliver deadly weapons to Ukraine. This means that the US is interested in escalating the conflict in Ukraine because it allows them to get closer to the Russian-Ukrainian border. America again shows its aggressive policy and the essence of its relationship to the south-east of Ukraine."

3725,"Secret documents show that just three days after the MH17 tragedy, the Ukrainian secret service conducted a special operation to wipe out all the evidence about the tragedy. They worked with the witnesses, demolished documents and relocated the military troops to other positions. President Poroshenko and his generals are guilty for shooting down the flight MH17, and the Ukraine Air Force participated in it."
3726,The Dutch Council of the State allowed not to make public the details of the MH-17 tragedy for two reasons. 1. The investigators have no hard facts and they are afraid that their conclusions will be disproved. 2. Ukrainian side has asked to keep it in secret because most probably Ukraine is guilty for the tragedy.
3727,"Bolivia has one of the world's largest lithium reserves, thus making it disproportionately strategic. In hindsight, it therefore wasn't surprising at all that the US would target Bolivia for regime change since it always wanted to dominate the global lithium industry and create a geo-strategic wedge for perpetuating its historic divide-and-rule policy in South America, both of which are in the process of being accomplished after the recent military coup."
3728,The proclamation of Catalonia independence and the conflict in the east of Ukraine are part of the  global powers' plan to prepare a ground for a war in Europe. These powers are interested in destabilizing the situation in Europe.

3730,"The last steps taken by NATO show that it is preparing a war with Russia. Jens Stoltenberg represents US interests, supporting its aggressive wars and unacceptable hostility toward Russia – things likely heading for an eventual showdown, the unthinkable possibility of nuclear war, an armageddon scenario if launched. It is the US that is the aggressor, Russia is just defending itself."
3731,"The Council of State in the Netherlands violated the law allowing to keep in secret the information concerning the MH-17 tragedy. The Netherlands military interests may be the reason for this. The Dutch investigators got the Buk missile from Georgia. And now they are busy not so much with the investigation of the tragedy, but trying to find out how this BUK can be used to shoot down ""other aircrafts""."
3732,The last actions of Ukrainian authorities [the new law on education] show that Ukraine is becoming a totalitarian and police state and it doesn't respect the Constitution.
3733,"The US accused Russia of being responsible for the sound attacks on US diplomats in Havana, Cuba. There is no evidence for such accusations, but the very clear reason is for the US to have the ultimate reason to seriously disrupt its relations with Russia. This media paranoia has one goal: to limit the possibilities of international trade, to break economic, cultural and other ties, to get all contacts to the level of the Cold War."
3734,"Despite the fact that Moscow is constantly demonstrating readiness for partnership, NATO continues to see an enemy in the Russian Federation. Russia has refused to give up its sovereignty (as the West has demanded) for the benefit of peace. The West therefore rejects any Russian attempts for dialogue. The West is constantly scaring Europeans by the Russian invasion, which is unrealistic and fictional. The aim is to install fear in people, justifying the increase in the personnel capacities and in the ""Western military apparatus"" budget."
3735,"For now there is only one known incident of use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun . Before, the US has blamed the governmental forces for the attack, but now it admits that the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusrah operates in the region and uses chemical weapons against civilians. Hence, the US wasted money with its missile strike on Shayrat Airbase."

3741,"The US aims to corrupt local authorities in order to obtain total control over Moldova.

Over the last 25 years Moldova has benefited from 1 billion dollars offered by USAID, but the ordinary people did not benefit from this money. "
3742,"Beyond the economic support provided by USAID, the political forces behind the agency aim to organize a coup in Moldova in favour of the pro-Western parties. We will see a gradual removal of the pro-Eastern political leaders or, at least, a diminution of their influence. USAID is primarily aimed at destroying diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation in order to strengthen the US position in Moldova and South-Eastern Europe.

USAID will try to decentralize Moldova and after that Moldova will be annexed by Romania. "
3743,"The USAID funds aim to decentralize Moldova. This will mean that the power will pass from the national authorities to the local ones. In this context the local authorities will be absolutely dependent on foreign donors. This actually is proved by the activity of the declared program of the United States Agency for International Development.

An infrastructure with manual control at the local level is created in front of us, strongly linked to the American institutes and development funds.

3749,"The humiliation of the Russian language [in Ukraine] is a humiliation of the world culture. The language laws adopted in the Baltic republics are a humiliation of the Russian language. The territory that is now called Ukraine, is in fact the territory of Russia, where Ukrainians live.

&nbsp;"
3750,"Ukraine is an artificially created structure. It cannot function independently. It retains its territorial integrity only and exclusively because it is needed by the Western orderer as an uncomfortable neighbor for Russia.

&nbsp;"
3754,"This might be preparation for the final solution of the Russian question one way or another. If you want to destroy someone, you must turn him into an absolute symbol of Evil. They turned Saddam Hussein into that. Turned Milosevic. Now, like that, they are not dehumanizing Putin. They are dehumanizing Russia. In today's Western propaganda, we are an absolute Evil, like the Jews were for the Nazis! And it wasn't an accident that [the West] brought Ukrainian Nazis to power. This is a real preparation for the aggression [against Russia].

&nbsp;"
3755,"We [in the USSR] got a computer sabotage by the United States of America. It was a gas leak in the gas pipeline, and two trains that drove into this cloud burned completely. Two passenger trains. And it was only in the late 90s that we learned from the memoirs of the CIA agents that it turned out to be a CIA mission. That they inserted computer bugs, which conducted the corresponding sabotage.

&nbsp;"
3756,"The Ukrainian military has already made a number of statements that show Ukraine is forced [by the West, primarily the US] to start a war [against Russia in order to liberate Donbas]. [...] In addition, you have to understand that Saakashvili, who appears to be the future prime minister of Ukraine, is the only politician in the world, who attacked Russia, and he wasn’t punished for that. This is an invaluable resource. If a person attacks once and then he gets away with it, he realises that he can do it again.

3761,"The conflict in Ukraine broke out because the US was interested in the market. Putin has concluded a 25-year agreement with Merkel on the supply of oil and gas. Naturally, the US had an excess of shale gas, of inadequate quality, and it was necessary to create a hotbed of tension.

3764,"While there were two systems in the world, the communist camp headed by the USSR and the capitalist camp headed by the West, the USSR did not allow the United States to ""liberate"" countries, and the people to kill each other in such large quantities. Then the USSR disappeared and it became possible to “liberate” anybody, and, in this ""safe"" world, people started to destroy each other.

3775,"US is now trying to set up the colour revolutions matrix ahead of Russia's 2018 Presidential elections. They probe our weaknesses and then they start to buy bloggers and buy [social media] communities.

Take Greenpeace for example. They work everywhere else but not in the US."

3780,"Obsolete, superfluous, sounds downright cute. It's as if the NATO states only had to stop paying and then leave the alliance cheerfully and without any obligation. But already on the way to the alleged end of NATO, the zombie eats the people alive: the undead demands two percent of the gross domestic product so that he can continue to threaten the world. In Germany alone, that would be 60 billion euros. That eats schools, roads, hospitals and ultimately the patients themselves. NATO is the highest expression of dying capitalism, a system that makes its profits from war and the threat of war. A system that eats up its states alive. A system that risks the atomic destruction of the earth to cement its own rule until the end of the capitalist horror film."

3786,"Some people name Kalinowski a Belarusian national hero. Recently Belarusian foreign minister Uladzimir Makei said that Kalinowski belongs to Belarusian history and that he is a figure in Lithuanian and Polish history as well. This is an awful logic. It implies that fascist collaborators are Belarusian heroes too, just as Wilhelm Kube [Nazi senior official in the occupying government of the Soviet Union with the rank of Generalkommissar for Weissruthenien], a Hitler's executioner of the Belarusian people in the WWII. A sacramental question to the foreign minister is the following: Won't the participation of Belarusian delegation in the reburial ceremony of Kalinowski remnants be a justification of Polish gentry activities to turn Belarusian lands into the eastern part of Poland?"

It's difficult to imagine why Brazil would be immune to this trend considering that it's already so sharply divided and even the slightest spark might set into motion very similar events as elsewhere in the region, which is why Bolsonaro must be anxiously sweating right now praying that he won't become the most prominent example of the US' Hybrid War blowback in the hemisphere."
3804,"Ukraine contends that the March 16 referendum, in which Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, took place at gunpoint. That bit, however, is untrue.

The presence of Russian troops played a role (more on this later), but it wasn't what made the referendum illegitimate."

              "
3821,"The two main [Bolivian] opposition figures Mesa and Camacho are a sort of marriage of business and fascism to pursue pure capitalistic interest, simply because the Morales government was left-wing and rather socialist.

This is typical for the entire region, as attempts against the Nicolas Maduro government in Venezuela are still on-going, for 9 months straight, but with limited, if any, success.

On the photograph are all democratically elected South American leaders against whom there were coup attempts simply because they weren’t politically aligned with the Washington-led establishment and were left wing.

The conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan at the turn of the 1980s, USSR's Perestroika, which provoked separatism in the USSR and the Tiananmen crisis during the late stage of Perestroika, were not coincidences.

A similar West-instigated ""Anaconda"" plan is currently targeting China.

4337,"Given that George Soros declared war against Donald Trump in 2016, an attempt to impeach the latter was apparently sanctioned by the Rothschilds. Although they do not threaten him directly, Trump's actions are constrained. This also suits the agreements reached between the Queen of the United Kingdom and Trump during his visit to London in June. The White House ends the investigation into links between a paedophile lobby and the US Democrats in exchange for a green light for a second presidential term. This is why instead of coherently struggling against the Democrats, Trump is attacking Joe Biden. The latter, though very corrupt, is not linked to paedophilia, unlike the Clintons."

Hence, the source of this madness is located outside the country. Among other things, George Soros' organisations provided support for Catalan unrest. The US is not happy that Madrid has been developing relations with Cuba lately. A quarter of all foreign companies registered in Cuba are Spanish. In terms of imports, in 2017, Spain was Cuban's second largest trading partner. Spain also invests a lot and is gradually taking control of the Cuban touristic industry. Hence, Madrid assists Havana at a time when the world's hegemon attempts to choke Cuba with sanctions. Some people in the US must have taken Spanish activities in Cuba as an aspiration to revive the Spanish colonial empire in a new form. Americans repeatedly warned Spaniards about possible consequences for playing with Cuba, but Madrid did not take the threats seriously."

4382,It was rebels who stored chemical weapons in the Khan Sheikhoun warehouse. Syrian forces attacked it and therefore people were hit by the stored chemical weapons.

The situation with discrimination against Russian media was worrying and resembled the Skripal case, in which nobody had explained anything. This is about Russophobia, the desire to justify one's own failures and the unfair competition that goes with it.

The same applies to the Boeing of Malaysia Airlines. Dutch prosecutors say that an investigation is underway, while reparations have already been demanded from Russia. If Russia asks where the data from Ukrainian radars are, where the airlines' communications data are, where the American satellite images are, it gets no answers.

Improta was named and shamed by the mainstream media, who claimed that his cartoon inappropriately used the Holocaust in political satire. As a result, he lost his appointment as cartoonist for the Rome city government’s civic education campaign.

But the real reason why Improta was subjected to media persecution was because he dared to question the sacredness of the European Union and thus expressed a view that dissented from dominant, “politically correct” globalist thinking.

Globalist cartoonists, instead, are allowed to freely use nazism, fascism and racism in political satire aimed at discrediting the political right. These cartoonists are not subject to media persecution by the enormous Spanish inquisition-like machinery that censors anyone who questions dominant globalist thinking."

It is obvious that any attempt by any [European] political leader to present himself as an important actor will be met with discontent in Washington. The US perceives the EU as an association under its military, political and, in part, economic influence. That was also after Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron tried to push through the idea of a European army, which is a thorn in the side of the Americans.

On CIA instructions Yakovlev chaired the campaign on USSR destruction. His campaign included falsification of the alleged secret protocol to Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Katyn tragedy, both based on Goebbels fakes. Boris Yeltsin, first Russia's president, was a CIA agent too. He appointed CIA officers to each Russian ministry, destroyed Russian industry and agriculture, science, education, and health care system, and inflicted larger damage on Russia than Hitler's or Napoleon's occupations taken together.

Belarusian politician Zianon Pazniak has been a CIA agent too. His mission was to invent the Kurapaty story and to assign the crimes by Hitler's followers to Belarusian people and USSR's NKVD, thus contributing to USSR's destruction. It allowed Americans to benefit thanks to USSR resources and technologies for trillions of US dollars.

Europe is already fed up with Ukraine. Zelenskyy is turning German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier into an idiot. Emmanuel Macron is pissed off. Donald Trump requests Zelenskyy to start negotiations with Vladimir Putin, to make concessions and to end a war with Russia which benefits the US Democrats.

The entry of Zelenskyy in power became a catalyst of conflicts between Ukrainian elites. They will result in Ukraine's collapse, because even the US - and its embassy plays a colonial role in Ukraine - will not be able to restrain the conflict, given that Ukrainian elites copy the split between American elites. At the same time, the US will not allow either Zelenskyy or Avakov to be destroyed. Hence the conflict will be developing cyclically until Ukraine's complete disintegration.

The main content of Lukashenka's course is to impose a Ukrainian-like Belarusian nationalism. There is no other way for Belarus to drift away from Russia.

Generally, a belief that Belarusian ruling elite can preserve real sovereignty is a madness. Belarus can only move to the protectorate status either under the West or Russia. Its present state is temporary and transitional, and it came into existence as a result of the USSR collapse. However nowadays Russia is proceeding with geopolitical and geo-economic expansion, and Belarus will inevitably be pulled back. The story of a province named 'Belarus' that broke away from the USSR is just a private Lukashenka's story. The time has come to make a geopolitical choice.

By becoming Russia's protectorate Belarus will preserve its economic and cultural identity. In the case of West's protectorate, Belarus will face economic devastation and forced Polonization by becoming Polish third-class agrarian colony. Under Belarusian sovereignty, the West means a total clean-up of Russian influence and status of anti-Russia."

The timing is suspicious, when the Trump Administration is losing its position in Syria, abandoning Kurdish allies and surrendering to Russia. Russian experts quoted by the Russian agency RiaFan call this operation a carefully planned forgery. The helicopters allegedly involved in the operation couldn’t have arrived unnoticed and terrorists in the area have modern anti-aircraft missiles. It couldn’t have been a stealth operation, so it was obviously staged, which may have included an agreement with the terrorists.

The claim that Al Baghdadi waited his captors to kill himself with a suicide vest is ridiculous, when he could have easily escaped from there. By destroying the house, US troops where simply trying to erase all evidence of the staging, when they could have destroyed it beforehand to kill Al Baghdadi. The US hasn’t presented any video footage to prove the claim. Besides, it doesn’t make sense that they killed Al Baghdadi when he was one of the tools to create ISIS under CIA supervision. Most likely, he was evacuated by the US given the Turkish offensive in northern Syria and the advances of the Syrian army."

5226,Catalonia will recognise Crimea as part of Russia.
5227,"The MH17 was guided by the UA air traffic controllers above Donbas. The Ukrainians didn't provide their radar data, and the Russian ones don't contain any sign of a missile, however because of the limited reach of the radar, it should still be possible that the Boeing was shot down by UA fighter planes that might have been approaching from the west. The claims by the Dutch investigators on the fatal cause of the disaster being surface-to-air rocket is therefore false. The truth will never be known, and that's because the US and its puppet Ukraine are concealing crucial information. The allegations of Russian involvement in the disaster are made up only to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea."

5239,"The OPCW skewed its own investigation of the 2018 chemical weapons incident in Douma, Syria to come to a predetermined decision.

A member of the panel which questioned the whistleblower also reprinted an OPCW engineering assessment leaked in May 2019.

At the same time, the Ukrainian nation itself was created by the Soviet power and the country's infrastructure was mainly developed by Russians.

For them, Russophobia is often perceived as good manners. Discrimination of Russians in post-Soviet ethnocracies is actively encouraged by the West. Russophobia is turning into a symbol of conformity with the Western system of values and is an important element of the ideological war that the West wages against Russia."

This ""positive agenda"" is not new, it was made a reality in the Baltic states after the USSR collapsed. They fought the so-called ""legacy of occupation"" using ecological slogans. This all resulted in the complete degradation of the Baltic states.

The Western liberal ruling elite promotes the programme of the future through Greta. This programme is extremely regressive as it denies human creative powers, science and progress and proposes the past to the world.

The Baltic states made this programme of deliberate simplification, degradation, and archaisation real. Under the mottoes for saving nature, they run through the Bacchanalia of de-industrialisation and de-intellectualisation. The Baltic States can take some credit for the ecological situation though. The remaining small population only happens to be bothered by beavers and wild boars walking in downtown Riga. Hence, the path proposed by Greta Thunberg leads to the dying-out as the case of the Baltic states proves."

The more Poland, the Baltic countries, and other Eastern European fans of American strength will tug uncle Sam's sleeve, shout about ""Russian threat"" and demand ever more American tanks, grenade launchers, and special forces, the more probable that Americans will betray and leave them to Russia to deal with.

In fact, Russia is neither interested in Baltic countries nor needs them. They are a godforsaken province, a dual periphery of the West and East. However, the Baltic countries constantly reproduce and attempt to sell the conflict, build their international image at the expense of Russia's demonization, demand NATO allies an even larger militarization of Russian border, and take West-Russia cooperation as a threat to their interests. Such inadequate allies may drag the U.S. into the entirely unnecessary conflict and force Americans to defend them a thousand miles away from the U.S. shores. Americans do not need this, hence they will easily hand Baltic states over to Russia."

6489,"The basis of the Russian World idea is a fair society and world order. Russia's foes are concerned about its prospects because it can potentially result in a post-Soviet reunification. Hence, the key tool of political war against the Russian World is Russophobia, i.e. a hostile attitude and hatred towards any Russian manifestations in the whole post-Soviet space. In Belarus, Russophobia is aimed at radically distorting the national consciousness of Belarusians. Its main tool is a doctrine of Polishness which presents Belarusian history through the lens of Polish-Catholic interests. The objective of the Polishness doctrine is not to turn Belarusians into Poles, although this scenario cannot be ruled out, but rather to change their cultural and civil belonging, to cultivate a hostile attitude towards Russia and the Russian World and to tear Belarus away from Russia. The competing civilisation project can be named the 4th Rzezhpospolita.

Polishness and Belarusianness bring a threat to the integration processes in the post-Soviet space and to Belarus itself. We talk about the threat of transforming Belarus into a Russophobic and anti-Russian country. In Belarus, Russophobia is presented in three formats. First, the openly anti-Russian propaganda of the Association of Belarusian Language and other similar groupings. Second, pro-European parties which hide their pathological hatred of Russia under European values. They always paint Russia in a black light and present it as the source of evil on the planet, their activities are based on U.S. and EU instruments. Third, the Russophobia of Belarusian officials, the most dangerous type of Russophobia. A number of state bodies and universities for humanities are its representatives.

All three types of Russophobia have a common objective: to take away the all-Russian basis of national consciousness from Belarusians, to turn Belarusians into haters of Russia, to create a ground for disrupting the Russian-Belarusian union, to revoke the Treaty on the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and to turn Belarus into anti-Belarus."

Unhappy EU citizens envied Ukrainians and learnt how to protest from them, particularly given that the Ukrainian coup d'état was named the Revolution of Dignity. A revolutionary fuse and potential in the EU is much larger than in the post-Soviet space. Revolutionary processes in the EU do not need external management, they spark spontaneously from time to time out of deep problems in the Roman-Germanic world. Europe continues to collapse, and the EU, in a pathetic attempt to stop this process by submitting itself to the overseas empire, is crumbling too.

The fatal error of European politicians is to follow their American master and repeat what the U.S. did in Latin America in the last two centuries. ""Banana republics"" can be created in the centre of Europe, but given the EU's much softer domestic structure compared to strict federal authority in the U.S., Europe will not stand it. Unhappy with the influx of migrants, Europeans rebelled and followed Kosovo and Ukraine as examples. Now the ashes of burning Catalonia are coming to Europe, which is seemingly about to collapse."

The Russian Federation Council (Upper House of Parliament) then said that NATO was flexing its' muscles and trying to demonstrate its presence in the western and southern border regions of Russia, while Georgia had become ""part of the NATO mechanism for influencing Moscow"".

The US has long had the idea of establishing a 'sanitary blockade' by states hostile to Russia - from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. (...) They will increase the pressure on Russia, and not just by their own efforts. Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Georgia should also participate.

What would happen to any NATO country which dares to oppose the US's intention to station a military base on its territory?

The US does not have partners, all are subordinates. The West does not have a partnership culture. It sees other civilisations as those which have to be taught how to live. The British guidelines of communication with the aboriginal people read: if others do not get it, speak louder. This is the Western way of dealing with other countries."

7229,"Since the 16th century, Poland has been the periphery of Europe - currently, it continues to be the European outsider. The economic growth of this country is achieved by the low level of life of the Poles. Also, the Poles have longer working week than any other country (after South Korea). The modern-day capitalists compensate for the lack of innovations in the Polish economy by the exploitation of workers and low salaries."
7230,Main political forces of Poland try to prevent the Ukrainian-Russian reconciliation – they are interested in the continuation of the conflict. They need this conflict to have an opportunity to continue frightening Polish society with the Russian Army.
7231,"The Polish political elite and West-owned media concerns carry out a large-scale campaign promoting the anti-Russian attitudes in Poland. Key goal of this campaign is to persuade the Poles that they need expensive Western weapons and natural resources (which are cheaper in Russia). The Polish public opinion is made to support these expensive projects through a threat, real or alleged."
7232,"Riga was liberated from Germans in 1944. The liberation of the Baltic states was itself a big operation and several fronts participated in the process. The Baltic states consider that their countries were occupied during 1944-1991. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union happened in accordance with the international law."
7233,"NATO became the tool of foreign policy for the US. Once the state becomes a NATO member, nobody is asking it for permission to deploy certain types of armament. This is how the missile defence system was deployed in Romania and the same is going to happen in Poland."
7234,"Ukrainian Euromaidan was not spontaneous. It was prepared secretly from Ukrainian society from outside Ukraine. This allows considering Euromaidan an orange revolution. The aims of Euromaidan organizers were to change the geopolitical map of Europe, namely, to destroy the Eurasian Union, to tear Ukraine apart from Russia, and to weaken Russia. The latter headed the resistance to Western neo-liberal order.

In this political game, Ukraine became a bargaining chip without any independent value. The revolution organizers reckoned that without Russian ties Ukraine will be ultimately destroyed by inner contradictions. Only a few people in the West were interested in the fate of Ukraine. They wanted Ukraine to make its case and to die. Today's Ukraine existence is fully dependent on the successful implementation of its only function, namely, to destabilize Russia. Euromaidan's victory meant that Ukrainian statehood entered into the phase of agony. This agony will continue until Ukraine will preserve any chance to conduct aggressive, anti-Russian politics."
7235,The U.S. and NATO have finished all the research and development of weapons and are currently putting them into service. This reminds of the intervention of the collective West in the person of Hitler in the USSR. He was allowed to gather the whole of Europe to attack our lands.
7236,"The [Orthodox Church of Ukraine] was created as a political tool needed for its backers to expand their influence and financial wealth. Agressive actions of the OCU undrmine the concept of the Orthodox Church as a traditional religious system [sic]. These agressive actions will apparently lead to a further split among the Orthodox Church [sic].

&nbsp;"
7237,The so-called Steinmeier formula has its first failure. It's about last week's agreement that Ukraine and the self-proclaimed republics will withdraw their armed forces. They promised to begin from two settlements in Donbas - Petrovskyy and Zolotoye. What happened instead? Petrovskyy was shelled by the Ukrainian security officers. In Zolotoye they carry out a certain operation of the combined forces.
7238,"The US Senate Intelligence Committee's final report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections offers no evidence, but many reheated allegations and allusions by so-called experts who have themselves now been exposed as the actual election influencers.

Not surprisingly, the ""results"" of the report are cited as conclusive evidence that the Democrats were right and President Donald Trump wrong about 2016, Russia, Ukraine and the US presidential elections.

The problem is that the committee provides no concrete evidence for its statements - just allegations.

Since Hillary Clinton blamed ""Russian hackers"" in July 2016 for the revelations about corruption within the DNC, the Washington establishment has been eager to blame Moscow for all the evils of the US political system, real or imagined. The Senate Intelligence Committee's report seems to be nothing more than an attempt to warm up the long-cooled corpse of a conspiracy that the Mueller report should have buried and left to rest in peace."
7239,"The US told Russia that the Aegis system could not be used for medium-range land-based missiles. The Aegis was already in Europe and prepared for Romania and Poland.

Russia was told: 'It cannot be used for medium-range land-based missiles'.

And then the US burst the bomb and announced that the Aegis system could be used to launch these medium-range missiles. At least they could take a longer break, after the withdrawal from the INF Treaty.

It is clear that Russia was deceived. The US tried to deceive us, and now the US just admitted it."
7240,"The enemy imposes a breakaway of post-Soviet countries from Russia presenting this as patriotism and protection of national interests. Real Ukrainian patriots are located in Donbas and fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Those who shout ""Glory to Ukraine"" are not not patriots but destroyers. They seemingly want to turn Ukraine into a concentration camp, to bring hatred among people and wage war. They are the forces who are used by external actors to destroy Ukraine and to turn it into the territory of a military clash of civilisations.

This is also true for Belarus. The real Belarusian patriot is the one who understands that Belarus and Russia are one body, and that together with Russia, Belarus has a future. The one who opposes the Union with Russia is not a patriot. He is either a foolish man or the enemy of the Belarusian state and people."
7241,"Poland and possibly Hungary are preparing documents on property located in Western Ukraine. Restitution is the key rule of EU integration. This is what Latvia went through and it had to return almost a half of Riga's historical centre to previous owners. Restitution of property on the territories of Bessarabia, Zakarpattia, Bukovina, Galicia, Volyn, and part of Podillia regions are open questions. One may wonder if the rights of the Russian empire over Kyiv can be treated as restitution too."
7242,"Today the Baltic states are trying to erase the memory of the rich Soviet heritage. Soviet power built advanced plants, hydroelectric power stations, ports, and housing in the Baltic states.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union the prosperity of the Baltic States ended. The handouts from Brussels turned the Baltic States into beggars and vassals of the West, with ruined economy, protracted financial crises and massive flight of people abroad.

7243,"Today the Baltic states are trying to erase the memory of the rich Soviet heritage. Soviet power built advanced plants, hydroelectric power stations, ports, and housing in the Baltic states.

7244,"Initially the media made the main contribution to the formation of an opinion about the “fault” of Russia for the tragedy of MH17.


When the plane crashed, the West, at the initiative of Ukraine, immediately blamed Russia for this. The investigation was one-sided, without the participation of the Russian side."
7245,Europe today faces very important task related to the settlement of the civil war in Ukraine. And creation of a new European security architecture.
7246,"Future military exercises of NATO and Americans in Europe are directed against Russia and Belarus. Russia's reaction will be extremely negative. Such large-scale exercises with Navy, Air Force and the involvement of heavy armoured vehicles, can be considered as very serious military preparations. Moreover, as preparations for war."
7247,"Ukraine, under the far-fetched pretext of violation of the ceasefire, did not start the practical part of the disengagement [in Petrivske and Zolote].

Ukrainian armed formations derailed the plan on the renewal of disengagement of forces in the Petrovskoye area endorsed by the Contact Group."

7252,"JIT ignores Russian arguments and data on MH17 downing.

The JIT accuses Russia of being jointly responsible for the tragedy. The Russian government, which has so far been excluded from the investigation, complains that investigators have ignored Russian arguments and data. For example, the investigation team did not pay any attention to documents proving that the missile hit by Boeing belonged to the Ukrainian army. The experiments of the Russian Almaz-Antey group, which manufactures anti-aircraft equipment, including the Buk systems, were also ignored, confirming that the Buk was fired from the area controlled by the Ukrainian army."
7253,"This week, the European Union literally stunned with more sensational news - they approved treatment with drugs that contain marijuana. They are allowed to be prescribed even for children. From now on, nothing prevents European pharmacists from promoting cannabis across the continent, allegedly for medical purposes. This has already happened in the USA."
7254,"The Ukrainian regime provoked the war in the Donbas region after its people rebelled against the coup in Kiev in 2014, which brought extremists with hostile feelings towards Russia to power in Ukraine."
7255,"A new military reality is being formed on the western borders of Moldova. NATO is constantly increasing its strength and armaments, creates secret special forces bases and conducts large-scale exercises on the borders with Russia. The goal of these actions is obvious - to intimidate Russia."
7256,"Today the borderlines of good family relations blur. However, they have always been preserved by the church. Nowadays we are told: there is no mother, no farther, but only parent one and parent two. They promote homosexual and lesbian values. It is so scary, it is a real enmity against God. Afterwards they stay in the condition of moral decline. It is frightening to watch those who live in such a dissolute and licentious way."
7257,"Recently, Norway carries out systematic work to propagate the image of Russia as an enemy. It is an aggressive anti-Russian policy based on provocative fakes."
7258,"RT was granted exclusive access to an underground fortress in Khan Sheikhoun, a former terrorist stronghold. According to the Syrian Army, the underground complex doubled as a film set which the White Helmets used to record footage of a fake chemical attack in 2017.

Back then, blame for the incident, which has never been definitively settled, was pinned on Damascus, and the White Helmet videos became a pretext for a missile strike on Syria by the US and its allies."
7259,"The evolution of the situation in Hong Kong will depend on the position of the true organiser of the conflict, which is the United States. The big promoters, student Joshua Wong and tycoon Jimmy Lai, have already been to the US to receive instructions."
7260,"Hunter Biden was pushing for the war in east Ukraine to clear the territory for fracking and allow Burisma, an energy company he worked for, to operate there."
7261,"Most of the leading US media have spent the last three years promoting the infamous Russiagate conspiracy theory on behalf of the Democrats, refusing to admit that they were wrong, though Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, during a two-year investigation, failed to find anything that would incriminate the US president.

There is a whole history of leaking information from the intelligence community in order to ""forge a false link"" between Trump and Russia and further the ""Russiagate"" narrative, and then blame Trump for the ""vulnerability"" of these alleged sources."

7263,"The citizens of Ukraine knew long ago that there is no possibility of Crimea returning to Ukraine. Crimea became part of Russia by the will of its inhabitants, according to the results of the referendum. That is why there is no chance for Crimea to return to Ukraine."
7264,"Crimea became part of Russia in March 2014 after a referendum, held after the coup in Kiev. 96.77 percent of the voters of the Crimea and 95.6 percent of the residents of Sevastopol voted in favour of unification with Russia."

7270,Today's Ukraine is not only an anti-Russian but also an anti-European project. It is obvious. The Americans have much more instruments of influence on Ukraine than Europe has.
7271,"Russia does not capture Ukrainians, because the Russian military does not take part in hostilities in the Donbas. The Minsk agreements do not state that Russia is at war with somebody."
7272,"European countries, NATO members and neutral (countries) do not have a sovereign right to formulate their military policies and strategies in relations with Russia. If they still have some chance for manoeuvre in their foreign policy, in military policy they remain led by the US. The US persistently imposes confrontation with Russia on Europe."
7273,"During Petro Poroshenko's time as president, anti-Russian hysteria was going wild in Europe."
7274,"Chemical weapon, sanctions, this and that, everything is staged. The last bloc of sanctions is a sort of comedy. They were imposed because Russia allegedly did not stand against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But there is not a single piece of evidence of any chemical attacks in Syria. All these [proofs of the] chemical attacks, all these white helmets… failed."
7275,"Ukrainians are not just fraternal people, they are part of a divided Russian people."
7276,"When we [Russia] at some point started to believe in peace, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry suddenly came out and unexpectedly declared: ""If not peace, then we have a plan B. And this plan B is war."""
7277,"If Zelenskyy resists the pressure from his opponents [who are protesting against the adoption of the Steinmeier formula], a long-term bloody conflict in Donbas will come to a halt and the Baltic States will lose their main friend [Ukraine] in their Russophobic interests."
7278,Ukrainians thought they would be able to sell their goods quickly to the European Union when they became associated. And nothing happens.
7279,"Latvian sprat companies struggle because of the Russian counter-sanctions. Even the Latvian state is not able to help them. In fact, the Latvian state’s main activity is the trade of Russophobia."
7280,"The point is not that Zelenskyy is weak, but that Ukrainian independence and statehood are weak. The current Ukrainian statehood was born from the Maidan and it will die because of the Maidan with a high degree of probability."

7284,"The rise in activities against the Russian threat is directly connected to drafting the new Norwegian defence budget.

Facts are not noticed even when Moscow is waving them under the nose, this happened with the witnesses of the Douma fake gas attack who were brought to Hague.

The situation is becoming worse as the public opinion is turning from politically correct liberal ideology to becoming mentally ill.

&nbsp;"
7285,"The normalisation of relations with Russia is determined by the implementation of the Minsk agreements, but here everything is very complicated. (...) The change of the situation in Donbas depends solely on Kyiv. Therefore, the conditions imposed on Russia are practically unattainable."
7286,"Poland might divide NATO and Europe into two camps in the near future. Poland says that its energy security is provided not by Germany or France, but  by the US. They want to buy American liquefied natural gas even though it is more expensive than Russian gas. Because of political reasons, Poland is going to divide Europe to carry out its plans and strengthen its dominant role in Europe."
7287,"For some reason, there is an impression that the non-aggression pact was signed only between Germany and the USSR. Before the outbreak of WWII, the UK, France, Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark, and Estonia signed non-aggression pacts with Germany."
7288,"The environmental views of ""Messiah"" [Greta Thunberg], to be completely honest, are far from real science. Her fight for the environment has the same relationship to the real problems of the Earth as the ISIS terrorists have to true Islam."
7289,"The US troops will be deployed in the western part of Poland near the cities of Wroclaw and Poznan. Taking into consideration the area of their deployment and their relatively small number, they cannot defend the Polish territory from possible Russian aggression. The Polish bases of the US troops are located in such a way that if the alleged Russian attack took place, the US units would have time to withdraw to Germany."
7290,"Washington’s strategists, inspired by the coup they orchestrated in Bolivia, tried several times to destabilise the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Donald Trump threatened to designate drug cartels as international terrorist organisations, trying to explore the possibility of creating a justification for military operations inside Mexico and in any Latin American country, in order to keep them as its backyard in the future."
7291,"Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, scared the world with ""information"" that Russia held an exercise where troops trained for nuclear war with Sweden in 2013.

&nbsp;"
7292,"U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal committed suicide jumping from the 16th floor of a psychiatric hospital shouting that the Russians were coming.

In addition, the Muller investigation on Trump's links to the Kremlin gave no results and now they intend to find the compromising evidence proving this claim.

Also, Norwegian media claims that Russian agents operated on Spitsbergen as well as on the mainland. Thus, the patriotic collection of amazing fantasies code-named ""Russians are coming!"" was complemented with another exhibit of ""Special forces in civilian clothes.""

This means that the phenomenon of the ""Russian threat"", ""Russian trace"", and ""Kremlin hands"" is becoming weirder and unhealthy in world politics.

7293,The Ministry of Education of Ukraine is going to close schools in large numbers and limit the teaching in Russian language. A new wave of liquidation of schools will lead to an increase in the number of uneducated people in Ukraine.
7294,"Ukrainian biometric passports were introduced under Petro Poroshenko in 2017, to ""cut off"" the residents of uncontrolled territories."
7295,"The war in Donbas has started after Ukraine had abolished the law on regional languages. Many forget about this. The Russians in Ukraine remain Russians, but Ukraine banned education in the Russian language, prohibited children from learning Russian. This is the reason why the conflict in Donbas started. This was the reason for what has happened in both Donbas and Crimea.

&nbsp;"
7296,"The Munich Agreement triggered WWII and the USSR was completely ignored.

81 years ago, the Wehrmacht invaded Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia as a result of the Munich Agreement signed the previous evening. If the reasons for the Second World War are to be commemorated in the EU today, it would be better to delete the reference to it, as in the controversial resolution of the EU Parliament - unlike the Hitler-Stalin Pact.

Such a policy had unfortunately been pursued so far and threatened to trigger the fourth great war, despite the written offers of the Soviet Union to France and Czechoslovakia.

The Soviet proposals were practically ignored. They had been accepted indifferently, if not contemptuously [...] The events took place as if there had been no Soviet Russia. Then we had to pay dearly for it.

&nbsp;"
7297,"JIT is not an independent investigative commission, but under the full control of Western security services. The fear that the official investigators might try to cover something up is justified."
7298,"Crimea carried out a referendum in 2014 after clashes in the Ukrainian capital which resulted in a violent coup d'état. The people of the peninsula voted to leave Ukraine and subsequently rejoined Russia. Later that spring, Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence and refused to obey the illegal interim government in Kyiv."
7299,"Since Ukraine declared independence in 1991, Washington has invested billions of dollars in creating and propping up a client regime in Kiev simply because it saw the country as a bulwark against Russia."
7300,"Russia is the global champion of free speech. There, citizens and journalists enjoy an unlimited freedom to speak their minds.

In this regard, Russia has largely swapped places with the West, where freedom of speech is progressively disappearing. In Russia, one is free to say ""I like Putin"" or ""I don’t like Putin""; one can say ""I like gays"" or ""I don't like gays."" In America, however, saying ""I like Putin but I don't like gays"" would amount to suicide."
7301,"The resolution of the European Parliament, which equates the Soviet Union with Nazi Germany, shows that Europe has become insolent.

Europe keeps forgetting the signing of the Munich agreement between Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and France in 1938. Also, before the beginning of the World War II, the non-aggression pact with Germany was signed by England, France, Lithuania, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia, but it seems that such an agreement existed only between Germany and the USSR."
7302,"Since the 1990s, Serbia has been caught in a sort of trap set by Western powers because it is Orthodox and from the bottom of its heart in alliance with Russia."
7303,"Ukraine has filed a problematic complaint through the European Court of Human Rights against Russia, alleging violations of the human rights of both individual citizens, and violations against the Crimean Tatar minority on the whole. But how they’ve gone about it, may require to determine – whether overtly or de facto – whether Russia’s control over Crimea is illegal. [---]

This places Ukraine’s claims in danger of being rejected outright, de-legitimising their claim, and perhaps even creating the de facto precedent that an international body with standing among the parties, such as is the ECHR, treated the Russian control of Crimea as a legal (or, perhaps, ‘not illegal’) phenomenon."
7304,Ukraine promised to fulfil this plan a thousand and one times and never fulfilled it. The failure to fulfil this plan is extremely unpleasant for Germany because a lot of German authority was put into it.
7305,"We are told that Ukraine is not ""waging civil war"". Because Russia supports separatists in the East. There are also accusations that Russian soldiers fought with them.

But even if Russia were to decide tomorrow to send several thousand soldiers to the Ukrainian front in all openness or to provide air support, it would actually remain a ""civil war"" in Ukraine."
7306,"In the four years since the presence of Russian air forces in Syria, much has been achieved, but most importantly, Syria was saved as a country."
7307,"Russia recognized 11 years ago the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which had been part of the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia and were seeking independence even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This occurred after a five-day war between Georgia and South Ossetia in August 2008, which killed 1,692 people and injured about 1,500 civilians in South Ossetia.

In addition to Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Nauru also recognized the independence of Abkhazia. Syria announced the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on May 29, 2018."
7308,"The formal reason for the sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the West was the situation around Ukraine, where, after the 2014 coup, a civil war broke out. Kyiv has repeatedly accused Moscow of allegedly participating in a conflict in the east of the country. However, the Russian Federation has consistently emphasised the groundlessness of such rhetoric, since Russia is not a subject, but a guarantor of the Minsk agreements, the task of which is to resolve the conflict in the Donbas."
7309,"The USA is increasingly expanding its military presence in Eastern Europe. It is a continuation and strengthening of the policy of confrontation with Russia, which has absolutely determined NATO policy for the last fifteen years. It is another step in the wrong direction - more troops, more military bases; more weapons on the border with Russia do not secure peace, but the opposite. They only show that NATO is actually pursuing a real war preparation policy, not a common security policy for Europe."
7310,"Kyiv declares that they cannot, will not, do not want to implement the current Minsk agreements. At the same time, we read that Europe continues sanctions against Russia. So who does not comply with the Minsk agreements? Anyone who wants to change them, probably? Kyiv? But why then do they impose sanctions against Russia? Impose them against Kyiv."

7314,"As written in your Constitution, your main aim is to surrender Ukrainian sovereignty to the EU and NATO."
7315,"Terrorists in the northwestern province of Idlib, in Syria, are preventing citizens from crossing into government-controlled territory through the Abu Al-Duhur checkpoint. According to intelligence data, numerous people want to leave the area, but terrorist groups operating in Idlib are blocking the functioning of the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian authorities, roads leading to the checkpoint have been also blocked and locals can’t leave under the threat of execution."
7316,"Secessionist plans to ‘balkanise’ Mexico by the [Mexican] opposition National Action Party (PAN) are gaining traction. At the same time, US Republican senator Daniel McCarthy threatens to “annex Mexico”, reviving the ashes of Nueva Vizcaya and the Republic of the Rio Grande in the 19th century. For two decades Mexico’s ‘balkanisation’ has been a strategic issue for the US."
7317,"[Former US Special Representative for Ukraine], Kurt Volker was continuously torpedoing Minsk Agreements, blaming Russia for the aggression, painting Kyiv in favorable light, all for financial gain.

&nbsp;"
7318,Russia agrees with China's stance on US and Western interventions in Hong Kong. China has compelling evidence that the United States and Western countries are behind the protests and illegal actions in the province of Hong Kong. 
7319,"It was simply impossible to ""dig up"" something that could prove the absolutely insane and naughty allegations of Russian meddling in the internal processes of the US."
7320,"

Tallinn is fighting furiously with its competitors - Vilnius and Riga - to get funding from the US for it's military investment projects. This explains the endless flow of messages about unproven ""violations"" of Estonian airspace by Russian aircraft. Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has been constantly disproving the unproven claims of Estonia.


Vilnius and Riga lack such ""convenient"" islands like Estonias Vaindloo, but they attempt to find ways to accuse Russia in provocations on border. They do it like Estonia does, without providing proof."
7321,"Greta Thunberg was “created” as a tool by cynical adults, using a special methodology. [She] is a response for the request to panic. This panic has been intensified. But by whom? There is no answer yet. They have successfully found the image of the protest, “the girl with pigtails”, Greta, a fighter for the purity of nature on Earth. They have chosen a teenager with autism. You cannot criticise her since it would be “politically incorrect”, this is a never-failing means of exciting society."
7322,"Protests in Hong Kong are following the Maidan scenario: with the same technologies, crowd management and same hatred of the authorities that is stoked by the Americans. America needs blood and victims in Hong Kong, in order to impose sanctions against China and to weaken it in the ongoing trade war."
7323,"While there is a significant grassroots movement of young activists, the CO2 Climate Consensus has distracted millions of people from an understanding of the broader and ongoing threats to human life on Planet Earth. These climate strikes are taking place at a time of crisis, largely marked by US threats to wage war on Iran. The use of tactical nuclear weapons against Iran is contemplated. Activists are often misled by those who fund the campaign including Rockefeller et al, as well as by the organizers and the public relations operatives involving Hollywood celebrities, et al.

In a bitter irony, the movement against capitalism is funded by capitalism. It’s called “manufactured dissent”."
7324,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy does not belong to the 'War Party', while Petro Poroshenko was the epitome of the 'War Party', which instigated the war in the East of Ukraine and caused the bloodshed of the Ukrainians."
7325,"The speech of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly was propaganda, he lied about the murder of opera singer Vasyl Slipak in the Donbas.

7327,The claim that Communism and Nazism were similar – stressed in the recent EU Parliament resolution - is an EU ideological weapon against Russia.
7328,"The creators and sponsors of this ""miracle in braids"" have turned up the farce at the UN. Who knows how far they might push this poor teenager.

7333,"The Baltic states joined the Soviet Union in accordance with norms of international law. Thus, the term ‘occupation’ cannot be used here, as no military actions took place. Also, the governments of the Baltic countries accepted the Soviet troops based on a clear agreement between them.
"
7334,"The popular referendum held in March 2014 following the Maidan coup, which in February 2014 overthrew the Ukrainian government with the participation of ultra-nationalists, saw the population of Crimea vote overwhelmingly in favor of reuniting with Russia."
7335,"NATO is developing a new plan of military operations in Europe that involves countering mythical ""Russian aggression"", the rapid deployment of troops from all over the continent and direct military support from the United States. Although Moscow has no plans to attack Europe, it is compelled to take defensive measures in light of NATO’s eastward expansion."
7336,"Political correctness has become a form of censorship in the West. There are issues that people in the Western countries cannot talk about, while the Russians can, and this is the strength of Russian free journalism."
7337,"The interests of the NATO and EU powers in the Baltic States are determined by the geographical situation and the possibilities to use the Baltic States as a disruptive factor against peaceful conditions of cooperation and understanding in the region and in neighbourly relations with Russia.

The powers of NATO and the EU are actively interfering in the shaping of internal relations of the Baltic States; their focus is on the creation of ""fear of the Baltic towards the Russians"". This fear can be instrumentalised externally for the goals of the NATO and EU powers for the control of Baltic States against Russia. An enemy image of Russia is created. The effect on the cultivation of Russophobia is achieved through the systematic fomenting of internal political contrasts between different nationalities. The Western powers need this atmosphere of fear and instability to justify their anti-Russian policies.

Especially after the accession of the Baltic states to NATO and the EU, the West has shown that it is determined to further develop this geographical area on Russia's western borders and to actively use it for its geopolitical goals. The nature of these measures, as well as the military-political steps, show that its policy towards Russia is increasingly degenerating towards military confrontation. For the Baltic Sea and its neighbours and for Europe, this means increasing militarisation and the danger of war."

7342,Europe is no longer interested in providing Kyiv with military assistance. The recent actions taken by Brussels show that the EU is willing to restore relations with the Russian Federation.
7343,"The distorted face and psychopathic manners of Greta Thunberg caused a negative response even from those who still treated the young eco-activist relatively positively. The term “pop-ecofascism” looks to be very useful to describe the ideas promoted by masterminds behind the ill girl. These ideas declare the readiness to sacrifice lives of people and use terrorism-like methods to achieve own ‘environment-related’ goals.

Even people that support the need to ‘do something’ with ‘ecology problems’ have a pretty sceptic view towards the new mainstream icon because her image of uneducated fanatic discredits the work needed to be done to solve the existing environment issues. Some even speculate that the girl is used to discredit ‘green movements’. However, most likely, the Greta Thunberg project is just a sign of the brave new world, which the globalists seek to create.

At the same time, the unelected global bureaucracy pursues some practical goals with their new tool."
7344,"Greta Thunberg, a sick girl who is as stupid as she is naive, is the prophet of the new totalitarian wave, which is something like radical Islam for the post-Christian West."
7345,The Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Vladislav Krikliy said in an interview with Radio Liberty that Kyiv decided to restore passenger transport links with the Crimea.
7346,"While the Belarusian opposition is concerned about Belarus' sovereignty, the Belarusian people support integration with Russia in the Union State. The people have to provide for their families and to work in Russia, whereas the opposition is tasked with implementing the West's goal to disrupt [Belarusian-Russian] integration."
7347,"Initially, Grybauskaite was a KGB agent, operating under the name ""Magnolia"". After, at the age of 53, she became the leader of independent Lithuania where she has fuelled anti-Russian sentiments."
7348,Poland became the largest beneficiary of EU subsidies because it positioned itself as a barrier against Russian aggression. The logic was to promote the Western European way of life [to Russians] by increasing Polish living standards. Many EU politicians followed this logic and provided financial support for Poland.
7349,Swedish social services suspect Greta Thunberg's parents for child abuse. The Swedish social services are questioning the parents of the activist Greta Thunberg. Staffers of the service were worried about the state of the 16-year old school child during her appearance before the UN General Assembly.
7350,"Greta Thunberg is a tool, it is a pity that kids are used for political purposes.The girl is a distraction from meaningful events, the UN General Assembly has turned into a TV show and a circus.

In the first place ""green blows"" will be directed against Russia and China. The West and the US do not agree with Russia's presence in the Arctic and do not agree that Russia is so rich in natural resources. They want to have a say in this and to dictate their conditions."
7351,"NATO training Rapid Trident-2019 was launched in Ukraine which is a response to the large-scale exercise  ""Tsentr 2019"" conducted in Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. If ""Tsentr 2019"" is elaborating methods to fight terrorism, Rapid Trident-2019 is going to fight against the imaginary Russian threat once again."
7352,"Estonia is on the verge of social and moral occupation. This year, in Tallinn, students began to study the history of the Estonian gay community. Do you know how this is explained? Firstly, it is necessary for general education. Secondly, for the social cohesion of youth. Apparently, basic family values are not enough. It is no coincidence that Tallinn is called the capital of the Scandinavian gays."
7353,The European Union is an unreliable partner which ignores all Russia's efforts to reconcile an equal dialogue. The EU is an unreliable partner because it continues to play geopolitics with Russia or against Russia. All Russian efforts to reconcile an equal dialogue and to renounce the 'friend-enemy' logic in the common space have been fruitless.
7354,"The recently opened Mine Action Centre in Straseni is actually officially part of the US European Command, whose head is also the Supreme Allied Commander."
7355,"[...] Trump is now openly unleashing trade wars not only against China but also against the EU. And all real wars began with economic confrontation. From a military and political perspective, Europe is defenceless. Its security can only be ensured by Russia or the US. By excluding Russia from this formula, unilateral American domination comes into play. By attacking Russia and blaming it for all sins including the start of WWII, small limitrophic European states deprive themselves of a second support point. Therefore they find themselves under the absolute power of its stronger partners, just as in the 1930s.

The EU attempts to come out of Washington's control, but the US stations its new military forces in Europe under the pretext of providing security from Russia. Today many options exist to destroy weak statehood without military means. The Ukrainian example is illustrative in this regard, and the Baltic states are not far behind. If things follow through, the fate of Ukraine and the Baltic states will look like a light breeze against the background of the all-European catastrophic hurricane."
7356,"Leveling Kaliningrad - such threats come from the Commander of the US Armed Forces. They act in such a way that treating this as a stupid joke is no longer possible. It looks serious. The Americans not only think, but also openly say how they will destroy Russians."
7357,"In the village of Starychi, a man’s body was found with gunshot wounds. The identity of the deceased was established as a serviceman of the 184 training centre of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after the hit man Pyotr Sagaidachny. A Polish soldier is suspected of murder."

7363,"Apparently, the new Kyiv government is in a hurry to turn natural wealth into a commodity and sell it to Western partners in exchange for another billion from the IMF."
7364,"The USA wants to divide Syria.

Great Britain, France, Germany and other EU and NATO states are to send their own troops and, above all, money to the areas of the north-east of the Euphrates, according to the will of the USA. This should secure the US's strategy, the division of Syria along the Euphrates, in the long term even after a planned partial withdrawal of US troops from the area.

7365,"The Ukrainian coup d'etat cost the US nothing or nearly nothing. After the coup, Ukraine came under the direct governance of US vice-president Joe Biden. When the previous US presidential administration was tearing Ukraine from the Russian sphere of interest, it must have felt a surge of adrenaline and endorphin. Obama thought he nearly tore Ukraine from Russia and interrupted brotherly ties between Ukrainians and Russia, something that no one did in the past, neither Charles XII of Sweden, nor German Emperor Wilhelm II, nor Adolf Hitler. Good relations between Ukraine and Russia were the obstacle for the US to get fertile Ukrainian soil under control."
7366,"The European Parliament falsifies history by declaring the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact to be the cause of WWII.

Parliamentarians accuse Russia of falsifying history. In doing so, the EU ignores its own guilt.

By concealing the unpleasant aspects of history and interpreting a retouched version of events at its own discretion, the European Parliament is finally losing all sense of reality. However, the reality is that Nazi criminals are being rehabilitated in some European countries, that Waffen-SS veterans and their supporters are moving en masse and that neo-Nazi organisations are feeling at home. This is now the real danger to the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.

Russia also strongly rejects the falsification of history. History must be written by responsible experts - not by politicians who misuse it for their own ends."

7368,"A leading FSB officer, Segey Beseda, said during a summit of intelligence heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that US intelligence had helped Islamic State terrorists get into Northern Afghanistan. He claimed that the goal of the US is destabilising the situation on the border of the CIS and then in Central Asia."
